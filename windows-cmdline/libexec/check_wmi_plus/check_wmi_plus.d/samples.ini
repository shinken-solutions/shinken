# the ini section names are specified according to 2 formats
# 1) [MODE]
# 2) [MODE SUBMODE]
# You use the check defined in a specific ini section by specifying 
# -m MODE or 
# -m MODE -s SUBMODE 
# on the plugin command line
# this helps us group similar checks together
# eg to run this minimal check which belongs the sample group
# -m sample -s minimal
[sample minimal]
# this help is displayed only when -m MODE or -m MODE -s SUBMODE are specified AND --inihelp is used on the command line
inihelp=<<EOT
Help for a sample check that specifies only a minimal amount of configuration in the ini File.
This sample simply displays the Name of the Operating System and Service Pack version.
It has no warning/critical specification and provides no performance data.

[sample uptime]
# this help is displayed only when -m MODE or -m MODE -s SUBMODE are specified AND --inihelp is used on the command line
inihelp=<<EOT
Help for a sample check that is similar to checkuptime. This one is somewhat simpler and uses seconds.

# Note:
# use the -d parameter to debug and see the query and the output returned from wmic 
# this helps build the correct query, get the test=, display= and perf= field names correct
# and shows you if you need to specify headerregex= and dataregex=

# The documentation for WMI for this query can be found at
# http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa394239%28v=VS.85%29.aspx
# Note that sometimes the field names returned by wmic sometime differ slightly to those listed by Microsoft
# Most of them are ok by some do vary (most in capitalisation)
# eg wmic returns "FileControlBytesPersec" but Microsoft lists FileControlBytesPerSec

# only use this field if the WMI query needs to have / converted to \
# useful to make the command line more friendly for the user since the use of \ on the command line can get tricky
slashconversion=1

# set the WMI namespace if it is not the default root/cimv2
namespace=root/cimv2
# eg namespace=root/MicrosoftDNS

# the Name field sometimes gets returned in by wmic for most queries without being specified
# it seems to be OS version dependent. 
# We recommend always specifying if it in the the WMI Class it to make sure queries are OS version indpendent
# Sometimes the Name field contains | - see info on dataregex field to fix this if needed
# for some queries you might add some thing like "WHERE Name="{_arg1}"
# When the query is run, {_arg1} is replaced with the value of ARG1
# Available substitutions are {_arg1} {_arg2} {_arg3} {_arg4}
# this will allow you to select a specific returned row when multiple are returned
# this sample does not use it but you will find others below that do
query=Select Name,FreePhysicalMemory,TotalVisibleMemorySize,RegisteredUser,ServicePackMajorVersion,NumberOfProcesses,WindowsDirectory,NumberOfUsers,MaxNumberOfProcesses From Win32_OperatingSystem


# ----------------------------------
#--------- Query Extensions --------
# ----------------------------------
# These help you create variable queries based on the arguments passed to the plugin
# Set it using this format - 
# queryextension=NAME|SUBSTRING|ARG|REGEX|DEFAULT
#
# If the ARG matches the regular expression VALUE then
# NAME is replaced into the query= setting by SUBSTRING
# If ARG has no value (from the command line) then replace NAME by DEFAULT in the query
# If ARG does not match VALUE then replace NAME by DEFAULT in the query
#
# So effectively ARG (if it matches REGEX) is a trigger to use SUBSTRING in the query
#
# Example:
# query=SELECT * FROM MicrosoftDNS_AType WHEREBIT
# queryextension=WHEREBIT|WHERE ContainerName = "{_arg1}"|_arg1|.|
# So if arg1 is anything then sustitute WHERE ContainerName = "{_arg1} into the query in place of WHEREBIT
# The query then becomes 
# SELECT * FROM MicrosoftDNS_AType WHERE ContainerName = "{_arg1}"
# When the query is run, {_arg1} is replaced with the value of ARG1
# If arg1 is not specified then sustitute WHEREBIT with blank
# The query then becomes 
# SELECT * FROM MicrosoftDNS_AType
#
# Another Example - use a query extension to specify a default value for ARG2
# queryextension={_arg2}|{_arg2}|_arg2|.|_Total
# 
# Although we've only talked about using it for arg1, arg2 etc it can actually be used for anything defined in 
# my %the_arguments = (
# );
# eg _host - so you could make a default value for a hostname if you wanted



# ----------------------------------
#--------- Query JOINS -------------
# ----------------------------------
# query JOINS help you join data from another WMI Class to the base query data
# if you are familiar with SQL then you will understand this immediately
# this implementation is a very basic implementation (when compared to what is in SQL)
# WQL (WMI Query Language) does have joins but wmic does not seem to implement it.
# You can specify mulitple joins in the order that you wish them to happen
# the full join specification is made up of a mtching pair of join= and joinquery= settings
# in the following format
#join=ID,INDEX,BASEFIELD,BASEREGEX,BASEREPLACEMENT,EXTRAFIELD,EXTRAREGEX,EXTRAREPLACEMENT,NUMQUERIES,WMINAMESPACE
#joinquery=QUERY
## 
#where
#ID=an identifier. If specified this signals to use a join state query file (ie cache the join result). If specified it is a short text String that is used in the join state file name to make sure it is unique
#INDEX= not used - the WMI query number in the base array that we will be joining data to
#BASEFIELD=the field in base query that we will be looking at for a match
#BASEREGEX=regex to apply to the value in the BASEFIELD - allows matching when the fields are not identical - we extract $1$2$3$4$5 from the regex and use that
#BASEREPLACEMENT=if this is specified it is used to replace whatever is found by the regex - use for replacing # by _ etc. Set to undef if not to be used
#EXTRAFIELD=the field in joining query that we will be looking at for a match
#EXTRAREGEX=regex to apply to the value in the EXTRAFIELD - allows matching when the fields are not identical - we extract $1$2$3$4$5 from the regex and use that
#EXTRAREPLACEMENT=if this is specified it is used to replace whatever is found by the regex - use for replacing # by _ etc. Set to undef if not to be used
#NUMQUERIES=Set to 1 for now
#WMINAMESPACE=The WMI name space if not the default
#
#QUERY=a WMI query. It should return at least EXTRAFIELD so a match can be performed
#
#Duplicates fields in the joinquery are lost as the original WMI query fields are not overwritten
#
#For a sample query using joins see checkprint test
#join=PrintConfig,,Name,,,Name,,,1,
#joinquery=Select Name,HorizontalResolution,VerticalResolution,PrintProcessor from Win32_Printer 




# create custom fields that can be used for display, perf data or testing warn/crit criteria
# for example you might want to average to readings of a WMI Raw counter
# the format of this field is
# NEWFIELDNAME,FUNCTION,FUNCTIONPARAMETERS
# where FUNCTIONPARAMETERS itself is a comma delimited list and specific to the FUNCTION
# we like to start our NEWFIELDNAMEs with an _ as you will see in the samples
# where we take 2 WMI values and calculate a percentage from them like this percentage=100* PARAM1/PARAM2
# we then apply the sprintf format string %.1f to give 1 decimal place
# we can then use the new field, _FreeMemPercent in test=, display= and perf= settings
# in this particular example we have
#           NEWFIELDNAME   FUNCTION PARAM1             PARAM2                 PARAM3
customfield=_FreeMemPercent,percent,FreePhysicalMemory,TotalVisibleMemorySize,%.1f,

#======================================= customfield FUNCTIONS ====================================
# DOCUMENT ALL AVAILABLE customfield FUNCTIONs

# any of the function parameters shown below can have a command line argument substituted into them
# for example to create a new field _TestCPU which is the _AvgCPU multiplied by the value of ARG2 do the following:
# customfield=_TestCPU,basicmaths,_AvgCPU,*,{_arg2},%.1f,

# ------ basic maths
   # it requires one completed WMI queries 
   # the parameters for this "function" are

   # SOURCEFIELD1 [0] is a WMI field name which contains some number or just a number 
   # OPERATOR     [1] is one of + - * /
   # SOURCEFIELD2 [2] is a WMI field name which contains some number or just a number 
   # SPRINTF_SPEC [3] - a format specification passed directly to sprintf to format the result (can leave blank)

   # used for calculating HyperV memory
   # customfield=_almost_total_vm_memory,HYPERV_TOTALVM_MEMORY,Value1GGPApages,Value2MGPApages,Value4KGPApages,DepositedPages 
   # select Name,Value1GGPApages,Value2MGPApages,Value4KGPApages,DepositedPages from Win32_PerfRawData_HvStats_HyperVHypervisorPartition 
   # it requires 1 completed WMI queries (sample=1)
   # almost_total_vm_memory = “1G GPA Pages” * 1024 + (“2M GPA Pages” * 2) + ((“4K GPA Pages” + “Deposited pages”) / 256)
   # 
   # the parameters for this "function" are
   # Value1GGPApages,Value2MGPApages,Value4KGPApages,DepositedPages,SPRINTF_SPEC
   # where 
   # Value1GGPApages [0] is the WMI Field for 1G pages - required

# 2) FIELD|UNITS (where we just display this field like FIELD=xxUNITS,
# 3) FIELD|UNITS|DISPLAY|SEP|DELIM|START|END
# where we display this FIELD like STARTDISPLAYSEPxxUNITSENDDELIM
# the default DELIM is comma space, if DELIM is set to ~ then none will be used
# the default SEP is =, if SEP is set to ~ then none will be used
# DISPLAY normally shows FIELD or whatever you specify as DISPLAY. Set DISPLAY to ~ to show nothing.
# if units is prefixed with # then we use a function to convert it to a scaled based figure using prefixes like K, M, G etc - the calculation is influenced by the BYTEFACTOR setting
# In DISPLAY/START/END anything enclosed in {} will be substituted by the value of that item of that name eg {DeviceID} will replace by the value contained in DeviceID eg C:

# eg BytesSentPersec|BYTES will be shown as BytesSentPersec=XXBytes, 
# eg _Used%|%|.|.||(|) will be shown as (45.2%)
# There are the following predefined fields -
# _StatusType - shows the status of the check eg OK, Warning etc
# _Triggers - shows which FIELDS triggered a warn/critical state
# _DisplayMsg - is _StatusType combined with _Triggers. We use this one all the time.

perf=NumberOfUsers|users|User Count (Registered User={RegisteredUser})

# If the check you are using can return multiple rows at a time (it uses LIKE and % in the WMI query)
# need to include the {Name} (or some other unique identifier - depends what is returned in your query) so that performance data is unique to each instance
# eg perf=TotalPagesPrinted||{Name} TotalPagesPrinted

# For checks that use multiple WMI queries and where multiple rows are returned for each query, 
# it is assumed that the same number of rows are in each query and that they are in the same order.
# This works most of the time for things that don't really change eg number of CPUs but could be 
# more of a problem for things that may change more often eg processes.
# It will result in the plugin showing errors or incorrect values.
# So if you are querying data that might change between queries eg process lists etc you need to fix this condition and make sure the data is aligned
# To correctly align the data you need to specify the WMI fields in a comma delimited list that make the list unique (like a primary key in a database)
# You could turn this one for everything but for some checks it will do nothing but use your CPU, so only use it where you might need it
# For things that can change but probably not very often eg disk drives, you will only get funny results once for each time it changes - which you can probably live with if it is not very often
# For example, your first WMI query might return ProcessA, ProcessB, ProcessC, but 1 minute later ProcessB has completed and ProcessD has started 
# so your 2nd WMI query would return ProcessA, ProcessC, ProcessD
# You need to align the data in this case
aligndata=
# eg aligndata=Name,IDProcess


# set this field to 0 to use it
# do not process all individual WMI data rows for warning/critical/display/perfdata
# if you want to process all rows returned in the WMI data leave this setting out or set to non-zero
# useful where you might be calculating all custom fields or only counting the rows
# or where you are using the createlist= setting to list the data
# see [checkproc memory] for an example
processallrows=0

# You only need this setting if you get WMI headeing fields that contain the delimiter "|".
# You probably don't ever need this, but it is available just in case
# Say the header comes back something like this:
# FreePhysicalMemory|MaxNumberOfProcesses|Name|NumberOfProcesses|NumberOfUsers|RegisteredUser|ServicePackMajorVersion|TotalVisibleMemorySize|WindowsDirectory
# All good - field names separated by |
# Notice how the Name field has been added by wmic and the fields are returned sorted in alphabetical order
# no need for a customer headerregex. This will be the case most of the time.
# If you ever need to use this refer to the comments on dataregex= as it works in the same way
headerregex=

# You only need this setting if you get WMI fields that contain the delimiter "|" - unfortunately this does happen
# Say the query comes back something like this:
#    1        2                     3                      4                   5              6  7    8     9    10      11
# 288976|4294967295|Microsoft Windows XP Professional|C:\WINDOWS|\Device\Harddisk0\Partition1|55|2|EveryOne|3|1228272|C:\WINDOWS
# Note that the Name field contains "Microsoft Windows XP Professional|C:\WINDOWS|\Device\Harddisk0\Partition1"
# This wrecks our standard field detection since there are now additional delimiters "|" in the data
# There are 2 ways to fix this - the easy way and the regular expression way
# 
# First the easy way - simply specify which fields you want to keep by listing the field numbers
# Field Numbers start at 1 and use a comma delimiter list
# So in the above example there are 9 fields delimited by |
# We don't want 4 and 5 (so we don't list them below)
dataregex=1,2,3,6,7,8,9,10,11

# If it is more complex than this (and yes this does happen eg event log queries) for example where \n is contained within the data itself
# then we have to specify our own custom regular expression to properly parse the data so that we can correctly recognise the columns
# the regex must entirely match the whole data row. We only collect a maximum of 9 fields for now with a custom regex
# the regex should end with \n since this marks the end of the line as returned by wmic
# the regex equivalent to the comma delimited list above is as follows:
# Field Num: 1      2      3     4     5    6     7      8     9        10    11 
#                               SKIP SKIP <--- regex skips the fields directly below "SKIP" but retrieves the others
#dataregex=(.*?)\|(.*?)\|(.*?)\|.*?\|.*?\|(.*?)\|(.*?)\|(.*?)\|(.*?)\|(.*?)\|(.*?)\n
# it collects field 1,2,3 skips 4 and 5, and collects 6,7,8,9,10,11
# most of the time you will not need to specify a dataregex
# the regex above collects 9 fields out of what looks like 11 in the returned data
# if you need to you would normally just a regex just like it with more or less of the 
# (.*?) parts and delimiters \|
# eg row recognition when you want field1, field2, field4 and  NOT field3 would look like this
# dataregex=(.*?)\|(.*?)\|.*?\|(.*?)\n
# Note the use of .*? to match the 3rd field without () so that it does not become a field we capture
# If you get this regex wrong you will be unable to correctly identify returned data from the WMI query

# number of times to run the WMI query
# if you are using RAW performance data, you probably want 2 samples to get a complete plugin result
# here's the tricky part -
# even if you plan on using the keepstate feature (on by default) and you need 2 samples to get a complete plugin result
# you might be tempted to think that you only need one WMI query per plugin run (which is what actually occurs)
# but since you need 2 samples to do the calculations you still set samples=2

# NOTE on Variable Substitution Using {}
# Command line parameters available for substitution using {} into query=, display= and perf= ini settings:
# _arg1, _arg2, _arg3, _arg4, _arg5, _bytefactor, _delay, _host, _timeout
# Each of the above matches the appropriate command line argument



# Special values available for substitution using {} into display= and perf= ini settings:
# _ChecksOK = the number of WMI checks that completed OK
# _ItemCount = the number of data rows returned by the WMI query



# WMI field names to provide calculated data (eg sums) for - not really used in the ini file for now
calc=
# If you specify the names of WMI fields in the calc= settings then there are some extra fields available
# for substitution into display= and perf= settings
# For example if you have a WMI field returned called "Size" and you want to add them all together and provide as performance data,
# then you specify calc=Size and then the following variable become available for substitution
# {_ColSum_Size} and {_QuerySum_Size}
# You could then stick perf=_ColSum_Size and it will provide "_ColSum_Size" as performance data
# Let me try and explain what these are ......
# Variables like "_QuerySum_FIELD" - sums up all the FIELD across all the queries for each Row Number. We use it internally to help us for checkcpuq
# Variables like "_ColSum_FIELD" sum up all the FIELDs (columns) within a single query - ie where multiple rows are returned
#  - you might use this for say, adding up total disk space. The WMI query for getting drive space can return info for all drives in a system
#     This is returned as the "Size" field out of WMI. If you have multiple drives you get multiple rows back in the WMI query and 
#     _ColSum_Size would be the total of all the Size fields in the query
#     We use this internally to help us with the checkdrivesize check

# create a list of fields that come back in the WMI Query
# FORMAT is createlist=NEWFIELDNAME|LINEDELIM|FIELDDELIM|UNIQUE|FIELD1,FIELD2,etc
# where  NEWFIELDNAME is the new field name to create eg _Processlist
#        LINEDELIM is the delimiter to place when reaching the end of a WMI Query row
#        FIELDDELIM is the delimiter to place between WMI fields on the same row
#        UNIQUE is set to 1 to only show unique items, set to 0 to show all items
# createlist=
# normally this is most usefull when multiple rows are returned from a WMI query eg a list of processes
# there is a good example of this being used in the [checkproc memory] section to create a list of process names with PIDs
# eg createlist=_ProcessList|),   | (PID=|1|Name,IDProcess

# this setting allows you to disable the default behaviour of keeping state between plugin runs
# keepstate is only used if enabled and multiple WMI queries are performed
# a check like checkcpuq does not want to keep state between runs but performs multiple WMI queries, so it disables keepstate
# since the plugin default is to operate with keepstate enabled, specifying keepstate=1 does nothing
keepstate=0
