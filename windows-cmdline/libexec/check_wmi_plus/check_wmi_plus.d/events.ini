# this ini file shows how to specify information used in checkeventlog
# define one or more sections - they can be named anything you like
# you can specify none, one or more sections on the command line using the -4 parameter
# eg -4 SECTION1,SECTION2,SECTION3
# this allows you to specify your im, is, em and es settings in one or multiple sections for maximum flexibility

# this section is included by default if you do not specify any other sections
# if removes some common warning/errors that you probably do not care about
# to ignore this section you have to specify either another section or no section on the command line
# eg -4 ''
# -------------------------------------------------------------------

# there are several different parameters that can be specified for checking of event logs
# you can specify multiple of each type

# when processing data all the includes are processed, then all the excludes are processed
# if you do not specify any includes then everything is included

# SourceName and Message are fields displayed when the plugin outputs the events found

# The REGEX below is performed in a case insensitive manner.

# exclude events that have event identifier 3221487625
# since this uses a regular expression if you want the exact id excluded then you need the ^ and $
# otherwise if you just used 3221487625 then you would also get events include 3221487625 excluded
# eg if eventid=000000003221487625000000000
ei=^3221487625$

# exclude any events with 1111 in them eg 8888888111188888888 would be removed
