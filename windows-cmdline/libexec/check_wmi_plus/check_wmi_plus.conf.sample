# Check WMI Plus Config file
# This is read in-line into the perl program, so the syntax has to be just right.

# The settings in here override the default settings in the plugin code
# This file is only required if you want to change the default settings in the plugin

# It is provided in the release package as check_wmi_plus.conf.sample
# Rename it to check_wmi_plus.conf and/or set its location right at the top of the check_wmi_plus.pl script

# this file makes it easier to upgrade the plugin since you can keep your old settings in your own copy of this file

# ---------------------- FILE LOCATIONS -------------------------

# we are looking for the dir where utils.pm is located. This is normally installed as part of Nagios
use lib "/usr/lib/nagios/plugins"; # CHANGE THIS IF NEEDED

# Set the full path where the plugin is installed
# You might not even use this variable if you have different locations for everything
# as a first guess, grab the directory that this conf file lives in
$base_dir="$conf_file_dir";  # CHANGE THIS IF NEEDED

# This is the full path location of the wmic command
# - standard value "$base_dir/wmic"
$wmic_command="/bin/wmic"; # CHANGE THIS IF NEEDED

# you do not need to use this if you are using $wmi_ini_dir
# normally you would only use this if you had a single specific ini file you wanted to use
# set the location of the ini file. Set to '' if not using it or specify using the --inifile parameter
# set this to something else if you want
# - standard value "$base_dir/check_wmi_plus.ini"
$wmi_ini_file=''; # CHANGE THIS IF NEEDED

# set the location of the ini dir. Set to '' if not using it or specify using the --inidir parameter
# set this to something else if you want
# you might like to use "$base_dir/wmic"
# - standard value "$base_dir/check_wmi_plus.d"
$wmi_ini_dir="$base_dir/check_wmi_plus.d"; # CHANGE THIS IF NEEDED,

# set the location of temporary directory - used for keep state option
$tmp_dir='/tmp'; # CHANGE THIS IF NEEDED

# this script helps with making the manpage help. By default it is in the same directory as the plugin itself
$make_manpage_script="$base_dir/check_wmi_plus.makeman.sh"; # CHANGE THIS IF NEEDED

# this is the directory where the manpage is stored when created, defaults to the same directory as the ini files
$manpage_dir="$wmi_ini_dir"; # CHANGE THIS IF NEEDED

# ---------------------- OTHER CONFIGURATION -------------------------

# Disable the check of Perl Module versions
# The module versions are checked because the are often the cause of the plugin not working correctly
# If you want support you will need to reproduce the fault with the supported versions of the modules ie enable this check
# Set to 1 to ignore the version check, Set to 0 to perform the check
# Setting this to 1 has the same effect as the command line option  --IgnoreMyOutDatedPerlModuleVersions
# Setting either this to 1 or the command line option will disable the check
$ignore_my_outdated_perl_module_versions=0; # CHANGE THIS IF NEEDED
