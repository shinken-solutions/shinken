	*Now broker get broks from pollers and reactionners. (Useful for Logs)
	*Give Broker a way to make broks :) (like for it's own log)
	*Add a problem/incident change states when apply. But it do not interfer with the standard check way of doing (or at least should not).
	*Add some LSB init.d scripts
	*Add max_plugins_output_length parameter to limit the checks output size.
	*"Hack" the old nagios parameters: now status_file and nagios_log are catched. If the user defined them, but do not defined the good broker modules, we create them "on the fly". I hope one day we will remove it...
	*Nested macros are managed (like USERN in ARGN macro).

	*Update the nagios to shinken migration file
	*Change the way broks are send from Arbiter to Broker: before, the Broker connect to the Arbiter, take broks like for schedulers. But Arbiter also connect to broker. That's a nightmare about hangout. Now, Arbiter push the broks. It's far more easy and efficient.
	*Add template handling to servicedependencies
	*Add test_dependencies as the regression test
	*Less status_dat verbosity :)
	*Add a last_perf_data + macros to access last perfdatas as in https://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/shinken/ticket/76
