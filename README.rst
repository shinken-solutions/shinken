Presentation of the Shinken project
===================================

Welcome to the Shinken project.

Shinken is a modern, Nagios compatible monitoring tool, written in
Python. Its main goal is to give users a flexible architecture for
their monitoring system that is designed to scale to large environments.
It’s as simple as the “cloud computing” makerting slides, but here,
it’s real!

Shinken is backwards-compatible with the Nagios configuration standard
and plug-ins. It works on any operating system and architecture that
supports Python, which includes Windows and GNU/Linux.

Requirements
============

There are mandatory and conditional requirements for the installation
methods which are described below. Keep in mind that you if use an alternate installation method 
(setup.py or simple extraction to a folder), you have to use
that method as well when you update or remove your installation.

The recommended installation method is the "install script" which tries to
do all the necessary steps for you. Use it if your OS is
compatible with it. 

You can skip/skim over the requirements section and come back to it later
if using the installation script. However, it is recommended to check any 
requirement manually to confirm they are installed correctly.


Mandatory Requirements
----------------------

`shinken` requires

* `Python`__ 2.4 or higher (Python 2.6 or higher is required if you want to use the Web interface)
* `setuptools`__ or `distribute` Python package for installation (see below)
* `pyro`__ Python package 3.x or 4.x (caveat: not 3.x for debian squeeze)
* `pymongo`__ Python Package >= 2.1 for the Shinken WebUI
* `pycurl`__ Python package for Shinken Skonf configuration pack management

* `multiprocessing`__ Python package when using Python 2.4 or 2.5
  (`multiprocessing` is already included in Python 2.6 and higher)

__ http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pymongo/
__ http://pycurl.sourceforge.net/


Conditional Requirements
------------------------

If you plan to use the `livestatus` module or the web interface, you will also
need the following Python packages.

* `simplejson`__ only if python 2.5 used
* `ujson`__  (ujson is used in Livestatus for added speed)
* `pysqlite`__
* `kombu`__ required by the Canopsis hypervisor and reporting module
* `python-ldap`__ for active directory authentication (needed by Shinken WebUI ActiveDir_UI module)

* `Python`__ 2.7 is required for developers to run the test suite, shinken/test/

Installing/Checking Common Requirements on Windows
==================================================

There is an installation guide for Windows and an installation package.

* `Windows Installation guide on the Wiki`__

Installing/Checking Common Requirements on Linux
================================================

Python
------
For Python itself, the version which comes with almost all distributions
should be okay.

Pyro
----
Under ubuntu, you can grab the Pyro module with::

  sudo apt-get install pyro

Under fedora, you can grab the Pyro module with::

  sudo yum install python-pyro

Under other distributions, you can search for it::

  yum search pyro

If you do not find it, or need to install a specific version, you can install it from PyPI::

  easy_install pyro


How to install Shinken
======================

You can use the install script utility located at the root of the shinken sources.
The script creates the user and group, installs all dependencies, and installs shinken. It is compatible with Debian, Ubuntu, and Centos/Redhat 5.x and 6.x
The only requirement is an internet connection for the server on which you want to install shinken. It also allows you to modify the installation folder in a configuration file.

If you want shinken installed in seconds (default in /usr/local/shinken) ::

1 - `Download`__ and extract the Shinken archive

__ http://www.shinken-monitoring.org/download/

2 - cd into the resulting folder

3 - run the installation script with the -i (install shinken) option

  ./install -i

See the install.d/README file for further information on installing plugins and web frontends.

Typical minimum installation using check scripts defined in Shinken, Shinken WebUI and PNP4Nagios for metrics.
ie. ./install -i && ./install -p nagios-plugins && ./install -p check_mem && ./install -p manubulon && ./install -a pnp4nagios

Update
------
1 - grab the latest shinken archive and extract its content

2 - cd into the resulting folder

3 - backup shinken configuration plugins and addons and copy the backup id::

  ./install -b

4 - remove shinken (if you installed addons with the installer say no to the question about removing the addons)::

  ./install -u

5 - install the new version::

  ./install -i

6 - restore the backup::

  ./install -r backupid


Remove
-------
cd into shinken source folder and run::
  ./install -u

Running
-------
The install script also installs some `init.d` scripts, enables them at boot time and starts them right after the install process ends.



Where is the configuration?
===========================

The configuration is where you put the etc directory, `/etc/shinken` (in
`/usr/local/shinken/etc` for the quick and dirty method, `/etc/shinken`
for the first two methods).

The `nagios.cfg` file is meant to be shared with Nagios. All Shinken
specific objects (like links to daemons or realms) are in the file
`shinken-specific.cfg`.


Do I need to change my existing Nagios configuration?
=====================================================

No, there is no need to change the existing configuration - unless
you want to add some new hosts and services. Once you are comfortable
with Shinken you can start to use its unique and powerful features.
