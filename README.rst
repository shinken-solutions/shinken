===================================
Presentation of the Shinken project
===================================

Welcome to the Shinken project.

Shinken is a modern, Nagios compatible monitoring framework, written in
Python. Its main goal is to give users a flexible architecture for
their monitoring system that is designed to scale to large environments.

Shinken is backwards-compatible with the Nagios configuration standard
and plugins. It works on any operating system and architecture that
supports Python, which includes Windows and GNU/Linux.

Requirements
============

There are mandatory and conditional requirements for the installation
methods which are described below.


Mandatory Requirements
----------------------

`shinken` requires

* `Python`__ 2.6 or higher (2.7 will get higher performances)
* `python-pycurl`__ Python package for Shinken daemon communications
* `setuptools`__ or `distribute` Python package for installation



__ http://www.python.org/download/
__ http://pycurl.sourceforge.net/
__ http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools/




Conditional Requirements
------------------------

* `Python`__ 2.7 is required for developers to run the test suite, shinken/test/
* `python-cherrypy3`__ (recommanded) enhanceddaemons communications, especially in HTTPS mode

Installing/Checking Common Requirements on Windows
==================================================

There is an installation guide for Windows and an installation package.

* `Windows Installation guide on the Wiki`__

Installing on Linux
================================================


How to install Shinken
======================

You will need a specific user for running shinken :

   useradd --user-group shinken

You simply need to launch:

  python setup.py install


Update
------

Launch:

  python setup.py update

It will only update the shinken lib and scripts, but won't touch your current configuration


Running
-------

Shinken is installed with `init.d` scripts, enables them at boot time and starts them right after the install process ends. Based on your linux distro you only need to do:

  chkconfig --add shinken
  chkconfig shinken on

or :

  update-rc.d shinken defaults 20



Where is the configuration?
===========================

The configuration is on the directory, `/etc/shinken`.


Where are the logs?
===================

Logs are in /var/log/shinken
(what did you expect?)


I got a bug, how to launch the daemons in debug mode?
=====================================================

You only need to launch:

  /etc/init.d/shinken -d start

Debug logs will be based on the log directory (/var/log/shinken)


I switched from Nagios, do I need to change my existing Nagios configuration?
=============================================================================

No, there is no need to change the existing configuration - unless
you want to add some new hosts and services. Once you are comfortable
with Shinken you can start to use its unique and powerful features.

If you find a bug
================================

Bugs are tracked in the `issue list on GitHub`__ . Always search for existing issues before filing a new one (use the search field at the top of the page).
When filing a new bug, please remember to include:

*	A helpful title - use descriptive keywords in the title and body so others can find your bug (avoiding duplicates).
*	Steps to reproduce the problem, with actual vs. expected results
*	Shinken version (or if you're pulling directly from the Git repo, your current commit SHA - use git rev-parse HEAD)
*	OS version
*	If the problem happens with specific code, link to test files (`gist.github.com`__  is a great place to upload code).
*	Screenshots are very helpful if you're seeing an error message or a UI display problem. (Just drag an image into the issue description field to include it).
