Shinken is a modern, Nagios compatible monitoring framework, written in
Python. Its main goal is to give users a flexible architecture for
their monitoring system that is designed to scale to large environments.

Shinken is backwards-compatible with the Nagios configuration standard
and plugins. It works on any operating system and architecture that
supports Python, which includes Windows and GNU/Linux.

Requirements
============

See the `Documentation`__ 

__ https://shinken.readthedocs.org/en/latest/02_gettingstarted/installations/shinken-installation.html#requirements

There are mandatory and conditional requirements for the installation
methods which are described below.


Installing Shinken
==================

See the `Documentation`__ 

__ https://shinken.readthedocs.org/en/latest/02_gettingstarted/installations/shinken-installation.html



Update
------

Launch:

  python setup.py update

It will only update the shinken lib and scripts, but won't touch your current configuration


Running
-------

Shinken is installed with `init.d` scripts, enables them at boot time and starts them right after the install process ends. Based on your linux distro you only need to do:

  chkconfig --add shinken
  chkconfig shinken on

or :

  update-rc.d shinken defaults 20



Where is the configuration?
===========================

The configuration is on the directory, `/etc/shinken`.


Where are the logs?
===================

Logs are in /var/log/shinken
(what did you expect?)


I got a bug, how to launch the daemons in debug mode?
=====================================================

You only need to launch:

  /etc/init.d/shinken -d start

Debug logs will be based on the log directory (/var/log/shinken)


I switched from Nagios, do I need to change my existing Nagios configuration?
=============================================================================

No, there is no need to change the existing configuration - unless
you want to add some new hosts and services. Once you are comfortable
with Shinken you can start to use its unique and powerful features.

If you find a bug
================================

Bugs are tracked in the `issue list on GitHub`__ . Always search for existing issues before filing a new one (use the search field at the top of the page).
When filing a new bug, please remember to include:

*	A helpful title - use descriptive keywords in the title and body so others can find your bug (avoiding duplicates).
*	Steps to reproduce the problem, with actual vs. expected results
*	Shinken version (or if you're pulling directly from the Git repo, your current commit SHA - use git rev-parse HEAD)
*	OS version
*	If the problem happens with specific code, link to test files (`gist.github.com`__  is a great place to upload code).
*	Screenshots are very helpful if you're seeing an error message or a UI display problem. (Just drag an image into the issue description field to include it).
