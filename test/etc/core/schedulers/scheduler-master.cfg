# SCHEDULER (S1_Scheduler)
#===============================================================================
# The scheduler is a "Host manager". It gets the hosts and their services,
# schedules the checks and transmit them to the pollers.
# Description: The scheduler is responsible for:
# - Creating the dependancy tree
# - Scheduling checks
# - Calculating states
# - Requesting actions from a reactionner
# - Buffering and forwarding results its associated broker

    scheduler_name      scheduler-master ; Just the name
    address             localhost   ; IP or DNS address of the daemon
    port                7768        ; TCP port of the daemon
    ## Optional
    spare               0   ; 1 = is a spare, 0 = is not a spare
    weight              1   ; Some schedulers can manage more hosts than others
    timeout             3   ; Ping timeout
    data_timeout        120 ; Data send timeout
    max_check_attempts  3   ; If ping fails N or more, then the node is dead
    check_interval      60  ; Ping node every N seconds

    ## Interesting modules that can be used:
    # - PickleRetention     = Save data before exiting in flat-file
    # - MemcacheRetention   = Same, but in a MemCache server
    # - RedisRetention      = Same, but in a Redis server
    # - MongodbRetention    = Same, but in a MongoDB server
    # - NagiosRetention     = Read retention info from a Nagios retention file
    #                         (does not save, only read)
    # - SnmpBooster             = Snmp bulk polling module

    # Skip initial broks creation. Boot fast, but some broker modules won't
    # work with it!

    # In NATted environments, you declare each satellite ip[:port] as seen by
    # *this* scheduler (if port not set, the port declared by satellite itself
    # is used)
    #satellitemap    poller-1=1.2.3.4:1772, reactionner-1=1.2.3.5:1773, ...
