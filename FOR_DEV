Here is a way to setup a shinken in "raw mode" without installing it really :
Install
-------
After unpacking the tarball move the shinken directory to the desired destination
and give it to the shinken user::

  mv shinken /usr/local
  chown -R shinken:shinken /usr/local/shinken

Update / Remove
--------------
Should be easy here.

Running
-------
It's easy, there is already a launch script for you::

  shinken/bin/launch_all_debug.sh

It will generate some /tmp/*debug files that you can use to debug the code :)
