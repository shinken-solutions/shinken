# This class is an application for launch actions
# like notifications or event handlers
# The actionner listen configuration from Arbiter in a port (first argument)
# the configuration gived by arbiter is schedulers where actionner will take
# actions.
# When already launch and have a conf, actionner still listen to arbiter (one
# a timeout) if arbiter wants it to have a new conf, actionner forgot old
# chedulers (and actions into) take new ones and do the (new) job.
