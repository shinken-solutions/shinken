 .
 1  USING AND DISTRIBUTING FONTS LICENSED UNDER THE OFL
 .
 1.1  Can I use the fonts for a book or other print publication?
 Yes. You can mention the font and author in the book's colophon if you wish, but that is not required.
 .
 1.2  Can the fonts be included with Free/Libre and Open Source Software collections such as GNU/Linux and BSD distributions?
 Yes! Fonts licensed under the OFL can be freely included alongside other software under FLOSS (Free/Libre and Open Source Software) licenses. Since fonts are typically aggregated with, not merged into, existing software, there is little need to be concerned about incompatibility with existing software licenses. You may also repackage the fonts and the accompanying components in a .rpm or .deb package and include them in distribution CD/DVDs and online repositories. (Also see section 5.9 about rebuilding from source.)
 .
 1.3  I want to distribute the fonts with my program. Does this mean my program also has to be Free/Libre and Open Source Software?
 No. Only the portions based on the Font Software are required to be released under the OFL. The intent of the license is to allow aggregation or bundling with software under restricted licensing as well.
 .
 1.4  Can I sell a software package that includes these fonts?
 Yes, you can do this with both the Original Version and a Modified Version of the fonts. Examples of bundling made possible by the OFL would include: word processors, design and publishing applications, training and educational software, games and entertainment software, mobile device applications, etc.
 .
 1.5  Can I include the fonts on a CD of freeware or commercial fonts?
 Yes, as long some other font or software is also on the disk, so the OFL font is not sold by itself.
 .
 1.6  Why won't the OFL let me sell the fonts alone?
 The intent is to keep people from making money by simply redistributing the fonts. The only people who ought to profit directly from the fonts should be the original authors, and those authors have kindly given up potential direct income to distribute their fonts under the OFL. Please honour and respect their contribution!
 .
 1.7  What about sharing OFL fonts with friends on a CD, DVD or USB stick?
 You are very welcome to share open fonts with friends, family and colleagues through removable media. Just remember to include the full font package, including any copyright notices and licensing information as available in OFL.txt. In the case where you sell the font, it has to come bundled with software.
 .
 1.8  Can I host the fonts on a web site for others to use?
 Yes, as long as you make the full font package available. In most cases it may be best to point users to the main site that distributes the Original Version so they always get the most recent stable and complete version. See also discussion of webfonts in Section 2.
 .
 1.9  Can I host the fonts on a server for use over our internal network?
 Yes. If the fonts are transferred from the server to the client computer by means that allow them to be used even if the computer is no longer attached to the network, the full package (copyright notices, licensing information, etc.) should be included.
 .
 1.10  Does the full OFL license text always need to accompany the font?
 The only situation in which an OFL font can be distributed without the text of the OFL (either in a separate file or in font metadata), is when a font is embedded in a document or bundled within a program. In the case of metadata included within a font, it is legally sufficient to include only a link to the text of the OFL on http://scripts.sil.org/OFL, but we strongly recommend against this. Most modern font formats include metadata fields that will accept the full OFL text, and full inclusion increases the likelihood that users will understand and properly apply the license.
 .
 1.11  What do you mean by 'embedding'? How does that differ from other means of distribution?
 By 'embedding' we mean inclusion of the font in a document or file in a way that makes extraction (and redistribution) difficult or clearly discouraged. In many cases the names of embedded fonts might also not be obvious to those reading the document, the font data format might be altered, and only a subset of the font - only the glyphs required for the text - might be included. Any other means of delivering a font to another person is considered 'distribution', and needs to be accompanied by any copyright notices and licensing information available in OFL.txt.
 .
 1.12  So can I embed OFL fonts in my document?
 Yes, either in full or a subset. The restrictions regarding font modification and redistribution do not apply, as the font is not intended for use outside the document.
 .
 1.13  Does embedding alter the license of the document itself?
 No. Referencing or embedding an OFL font in any document does not change the license of the document itself. The requirement for fonts to remain under the OFL does not apply to any document created using the fonts and their derivatives. Similarly, creating any kind of graphic using a font under OFL does not make the resulting artwork subject to the OFL.
 .
 1.14  If OFL fonts are extracted from a document in which they are embedded (such as a PDF file), what can be done with them? Is this a risk to author(s)?
 The few utilities that can extract fonts embedded in a PDF will typically output limited amounts of outlines - not a complete font. To create a working font from this method is much more difficult and time consuming than finding the source of the original OFL font. So there is little chance that an OFL font would be extracted and redistributed inappropriately through this method. Even so, copyright laws address any misrepresentation of authorship. All Font Software released under the OFL and marked as such by the author(s) is intended to remain under this license regardless of the distribution method, and cannot be redistributed under any other license. We strongly discourage any font extraction - we recommend directly using the font sources instead - but if you extract font outlines from a document, please be considerate: use your common sense and respect the work of the author(s) and the licensing model.
 .
 1.15  What about distributing fonts with a document? Within a compressed folder structure? Is it distribution, bundling or embedding?
 Certain document formats may allow the inclusion of an unmodified font within their file structure which consists of a compressed folder containing the various resources forming the document (such as pictures and thumbnails). Including fonts within such a structure is understood as being different from embedding but rather similar to bundling (or mere aggregation) which the license explicitly allows. In this case the font is conveyed unchanged whereas embedding a font usually transforms it from the original format. The OFL does not allow anyone to extract the font from such a structure to then redistribute it under another license. The explicit permission to redistribute and embed does not cancel the requirement for the Font Software to remain under the license chosen by its author(s).
 .
 1.16  What about ebooks shipping with open fonts?
 The requirements differ depending on whether the fonts are linked, embedded or distributed (bundled or aggregated). Some ebook formats use web technologies to do font linking via @font-face, others are designed for font embedding, some use fonts distributed with the document or reading software, and a few rely solely on the fonts already present on the target system. The license requirements depend on the type of inclusion as discussed in 1.15.
 .
 1.17  Can Font Software released under the OFL be subject to URL-based access restrictions methods or DRM (Digital Rights Management) mechanisms?
 Yes, but these issues are out-of-scope for the OFL. The license itself neither encourages their use nor prohibits them since such mechanisms are not implemented in the components of the Font Software but through external software. Such restrictions are put in place for many different purposes corresponding to various usage scenarios. One common example is to limit potentially dangerous cross-site scripting attacks. However, in the spirit of libre/open fonts and unrestricted writing systems, we strongly encourage open sharing and reuse of OFL fonts, and the establishment of an environment where such restrictions are unnecessary. Note that whether you wish to use such mechanisms or you prefer not to, you must still abide by the rules set forth by the OFL when using fonts released by their authors under this license. Derivative fonts must be licensed under the OFL, even if they are part of a service for which you charge fees and/or for which access to source code is restricted. You may not sell the fonts on their own - they must be part of a larger software package, bundle or subscription plan. For example, even if the OFL font is distributed in a software package or via an online service using a DRM mechanism, the user would still have the right to extract that font, use, study, modify and redistribute it under the OFL.
 .
 1.18  I've come across a font released under the OFL. How can I easily get more information about the Original Version? How can I know where it stands compared to the Original Version or other Modified Versions?
 Consult the copyright statement(s) in the license for ways to contact the original authors. Consult the FONTLOG for information on how the font differs from the Original Version, and get in touch with the various contributors via the information in the acknowledgement section. Please consider using the Original Versions of the fonts whenever possible.
 .
 1.19  What do you mean in condition 4? Can you provide examples of abusive promotion / endorsement / advertisement vs. normal acknowledgement?
 The intent is that the goodwill and reputation of the author(s) should not be used in a way that makes it sound like the original author(s) endorse or approve of a specific Modified Version or software bundle. For example, it would not be right to advertise a word processor by naming the author(s) in a listing of software features, or to promote a Modified Version on a web site by saying "designed by ...". However, it would be appropriate to acknowledge the author(s) if your software package has a list of people who deserve thanks. We realize that this can seem to be a grey area, but the standard used to judge an acknowledgement is that if the acknowledgement benefits the author(s) it is allowed, but if it primarily benefits other parties, or could reflect poorly on the author(s), then it is not.
 .
 .
 2  USING OFL FONTS FOR WEBPAGES AND ONLINE WEBFONT SERVICES
 .
 2.1  Can I make webpages using these fonts?
 Yes! Go ahead! Using CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is recommended. Your three best options: 
 - referring directly in your stylesheet to open fonts which may be available on the user's system
 - providing links to download the full package of the font - either from your own website or from elsewhere - so users can install it themselves
 - using @font-face to distribute the font directly to browsers. This is recommended and explicitly allowed by the licensing model because it is distribution. The font file itself is distributed with other components of the webpage. It is not embedded in the webpage but referenced through a web address which will cause the browser to retrieve and use the corresponding font to render the webpage (see 1.11 and 1.15 for details related to embedding fonts into documents). As you take advantage of the @font-face cross-platform standard, be aware that webfonts are often tuned for a web environment and not intended for installation and use outside a browser. The reasons in favour of using webfonts are to allow design of dynamic text elements instead of static graphics, to make it easier for content to be localized and translated, indexed and searched, and all this with cross-platform open standards without depending on restricted extensions or plugins. You should check the CSS cascade (the order in which fonts are being called or delivered to your users) when testing.
 .
 2.2  Can I make and use WOFF (Web Open Font Format) versions of OFL fonts?
 Yes, but you need to be careful. A change in font format normally is considered modification, and Reserved Font Names (RFNs) cannot be used. Because of the design of the WOFF format, however, it is possible to create a WOFF version that is not considered modification, and so would not require a name change. You are allowed to create, use and distribute a WOFF version of an OFL font without changing the font name, but only if:
 .
 - the original font data remains unchanged except for WOFF compression, and
 - WOFF-specific metadata is either omitted altogether or present and includes, unaltered, the contents of all equivalent metadata in the original font.
 .
 If the original font data or metadata is changed, or the WOFF-specific metadata is incomplete, the font must be considered a Modified Version, the OFL restrictions would apply and the name of the font must be changed: any RFNs cannot be used and copyright notices and licensing information must be included and cannot be deleted or modified. You must come up with a unique name - we recommend one corresponding to your domain or your particular web application. Be aware that only the original author(s) can use RFNs. This is to prevent collisions between a derivative tuned to your audience and the original upstream version and so to reduce confusion.
 .
 Please note that most WOFF conversion tools and online services do not meet the two requirements listed above, and so their output must be considered a Modified Version. So be very careful and check to be sure that the tool or service you're using is compressing unchanged data and completely and accurately reflecting the original font metadata.
 .
 2.3  What about other webfont formats such as EOT/EOTLite/CWT/etc.?
 In most cases these formats alter the original font data more than WOFF, and do not completely support appropriate metadata, so their use must be considered modification and RFNs may not be used.
 .
 2.4  Can I make OFL fonts available through webfont online services?
 Yes, you are welcome to include OFL fonts in online webfont services as long as you properly meet all the conditions of the license. The origin and open status of the font should be clear among the other fonts you are hosting. Authorship, copyright notices and license information must be sufficiently visible to your users or subscribers so they know where the font comes from and the rights granted by the author(s). Make sure the font file contains the needed copyright notice(s) and licensing information in its metadata. Please double-check the accuracy of every field to prevent contradictory information. Other font formats, including EOT/EOTLite/CWT and superior alternatives like WOFF, already provide fields for this information. Remember that if you modify the font within your library or convert it to another format for any reason the OFL restrictions apply and you need to change the names accordingly. Please respect the author's wishes as expressed in the OFL and do not misrepresent original designers and their work. Don't lump quality open fonts together with dubious freeware or public domain fonts. Consider how you can best work with the original designers and foundries, support their efforts and generate goodwill that will benefit your service. (See 1.17 for details related to URL-based access restrictions methods or DRM mechanisms).
 .
 2.5  Can I make and publish CMS themes or templates that use OFL fonts?  Can I include the fonts themselves in the themes or templates? Can I sell the whole package?
 Yes, you are very welcome to integrate open fonts into themes and templates for your preferred CMS and make them more widely available. Be aware that you can only sell the fonts and your CMS add-on as part of a software bundle. (See 1.4 for details and examples about selling bundles). 
 .
 2.6  Some webfont formats and services provide ways of "optimising" the font for a particular website or web application; is that allowed? 
 Yes, it is permitted, but remember that these optimised versions are Modified Versions and so must follow OFL requirements like appropriate renaming. Also you need to bear in mind the other important parameters beyond compression, speed and responsiveness: you need to consider the audience of your particular website or web application, as choosing some optimisation parameters may turn out to be less than ideal for them. Subsetting by removing certain glyphs or features may seriously limit functionality of the font in various languages used by your users. It may also introduce degradation of quality in the rendering or specific bugs on the various platforms compared to the original font. In other words, remember that one person's optimised font may be another person's missing feature. Various advanced typographic features are also available through CSS and may provide the desired effects without the need to modify the font.
 .
 .
 3  MODIFYING OFL-LICENSED FONTS
 .
 3.1  Can I change the fonts? Are there any limitations to what things I can and cannot change?
 You are allowed to change anything, as long as such changes do not violate the terms of the license. In other words, you are not allowed to remove the copyright statement(s) from the font, but you could put additional information into it that covers your contribution.
 .
 3.2  I have a font that needs a few extra glyphs - can I take them from an OFL licensed font and copy them into mine?
 Yes, but if you distribute that font to others it must be under the OFL, and include the information mentioned in condition 2 of the license.
 .
 3.3  Can I charge people for my additional work? In other words, if I add a bunch of special glyphs and/or OpenType/Graphite code, can I sell the enhanced font?
 Not by itself. Derivative fonts must be released under the OFL and cannot be sold by themselves. It is permitted, however, to include them in a larger software package (such as text editors, office suites or operating systems), even if the larger package is sold. In that case, you are strongly encouraged, but not required, to also make that derived font easily and freely available outside of the larger package.
 .
 3.4  Can I pay someone to enhance the fonts for my use and distribution?
 Yes. This is a good way to fund the further development of the fonts. Keep in mind, however, that if the font is distributed to others it must be under the OFL. You won't be able to recover your investment by exclusively selling the font, but you will be making a valuable contribution to the community. Please remember how you have benefited from the contributions of others.
 .
 3.5  I need to make substantial revisions to the font to make it work with my program. It will be a lot of work, and a big investment, and I want to be sure that it can only be distributed with my program. Can I restrict its use?
 No. If you redistribute a Modified Version of the font it must be under the OFL. You may not restrict it in any way beyond what the OFL permits and requires. This is intended to ensure that all released improvements to the fonts become available to everyone. But you will likely get an edge over competitors by being the first to distribute a bundle with the enhancements. Again, please remember how you have benefited from the contributions of others.
 .
 3.6  Do I have to make any derivative fonts (including extended source files, build scripts, documentation, etc.) publicly available?
 No, but please consider sharing your improvements with others. You may find that you receive in return more than what you gave.
 .
 3.7  If a trademark is claimed in the OFL font, does that trademark need to remain in modified fonts?
 Yes, any trademark notices must remain in any derivative fonts to respect trademark laws, but you may add any additional trademarks you claim, officially registered or not. For example if an OFL font called "Foo" contains a notice that "Foo is a trademark of Acme", then if you rename the font to "Bar" when creating a Modified Version, the new trademark notice could say "Foo is a trademark of Acme Inc. - Bar is a trademark of Roadrunner Technologies Ltd.". Trademarks work alongside the OFL and are not subject to the terms of the licensing agreement. Please refer to the appropriate trademark laws.
 .
 .
 4  LICENSING YOUR ORIGINAL FONTS UNDER THE OFL
 .
 4.1  Can I use the SIL OFL for my own fonts?
 Yes! We heartily encourage everyone to use the OFL to distribute their own original fonts. It is a carefully constructed license that allows great freedom along with enough artistic integrity protection for the work of the authors as well as clear rules for other contributors and those who redistribute the fonts. The licensing model is used successfully by various organisations, both for-profit and not-for-profit, to release fonts of varying levels of scope and complexity.
 .
 4.2  What do I have to do to apply the OFL to my font?
 If you want to release your fonts under the OFL, we recommend you do the following:
 .
 4.2.1  Put your copyright and Reserved Font Names information at the beginning of the main OFL.txt file in place of the dedicated placeholders. Include this file in your release package.
 .
 4.2.2  Put your copyright and the OFL text with Reserved Font Names into your font files (the copyright and license fields). A link to the OFL text on the OFL web site is an acceptable (but not recommended) alternative. Also add this information to any other components (build scripts, glyph databases, documentation, test files, etc). Depending on the format of your fonts and sources, you can use template human-readable headers or machine-readable metadata.
 .
 4.2.3  Write an initial FONTLOG.txt for your font and include it in the release package.
 .
 4.2.4  Include the relevant practical documentation on the license by including the OFL-FAQ.txt in your package.
 .
 4.3  Will you make my font OFL for me?
 We won't do the work for you. We can, however, try to answer your questions, unfortunately we do not have the resources to review and check your font packages for correct use of the OFL.
 .
 4.4  Will you distribute my OFL font for me?
 No, although if the font is of sufficient quality and general interest we may include a link to it on our partial list of OFL fonts on the OFL web site. You may wish to consider other open font catalogs or hosting services, such as the Unifont Font Guide (http://unifont.org/fontguide), The League of Movable Type (http://theleagueofmovabletype.com), Kernest (http://kernest.com/) or the Open Font Library (http://openfontlibrary.org/), which despite the name has no direct relationship to the OFL or SIL. We do not endorse any particular catalog or hosting service - it is your responsibility to determine if the service is right for you.
 .
 4.5  Why should I use the OFL for my fonts?
 - to meet needs for fonts that can be modified to support minority languages
 - to provide a legal and clear way for people to respect your work but still use it (and reduce piracy)
 - to involve others in your font project
 - to enable your fonts to be expanded with new weights and improved writing system/language support
 - to allow more technical font developers to add features to your design (such as OpenType and Graphite support)
 - to renew the life of an old font lying on your hard drive with no business model
 - to allow your font to be included in Libre Software operating systems like Ubuntu
 - to give your font world status and wide, unrestricted distribution
 - to educate students about quality typeface and font design

 5  CHOOSING RESERVED FONT NAMES
 .
 5.1  What are Reserved Font Names?
 These are font names, or portions of font names, that the author has chosen to reserve for use only with the Original Version of the font, or for Modified Version(s) created by the original author.
 .
 5.2  Why can't I use the Reserved Font Names in my derivative font names? I'd like people to know where the design came from.
 The best way to acknowledge the source of the design is to thank the original authors and any other contributors in the files that are distributed with your revised font (although no acknowledgement is required). The FONTLOG is a natural place to do this. Reserved Font Names ensure that the only fonts that have the original names are the unmodified Original Versions. This allows designers to maintain artistic integrity while allowing collaboration to happen. It eliminates potential confusion and name conflicts. When choosing a name, be creative and avoid names that reuse almost all the same letters in the same order or sound like the original. It will help everyone if Original Versions and Modified Versions can easily be distinguished from one another and from other derivatives. Any substitution and matching mechanism is outside the scope of the license.
 .
 5.3  What do you mean by "primary name as presented to the user"? Are you referring to the font menu name?
 Yes, this applies to the font menu name and other mechanisms that specify a font in a document. It would be fine, however, to keep a text reference to the original fonts in the description field, in your modified source file or in documentation provided alongside your derivative as long as no one could be confused that your modified source is the original. But you cannot use the Reserved Font Names in any way to identify the font to the user (unless the Copyright Holder(s) allow(s) it through a separate agreement). Users who install derivatives (Modified Versions) on their systems should not see any of the original Reserved Font Names in their font menus, for example. Again, this is to ensure that users are not confused and do not mistake one font for another and so expect features only another derivative or the Original Version can actually offer. 
 .
 5.4  Am I not allowed to use any part of the Reserved Font Names?
 You may not use individual words from the Reserved Font Names, but you would be allowed to use parts of words, as long as you do not use any word from the Reserved Font Names entirely. We do not recommend using parts of words because of potential confusion, but it is allowed. For example, if "Foobar" was a Reserved Font Name, you would be allowed to use "Foo" or "bar", although we would not recommend it. Such an unfortunate choice would confuse the users of your fonts as well as make it harder for other designers to contribute.
 .
 5.5  So what should I, as an author, identify as Reserved Font Names?
 Original authors are encouraged to name their fonts using clear, distinct names, and only declare the unique parts of the name as Reserved Font Names. For example, the author of a font called "Foobar Sans" would declare "Foobar" as a Reserved Font Name, but not "Sans", as that is a common typographical term, and may be a useful word to use in a derivative font name. Reserved Font Names should also be single words. A font called "Flowing River" should have Reserved Font Names "Flowing" and "River", not "Flowing River". You also need to be very careful about reserving font names which are already linked to trademarks (whether registered or not) which you do not own.
 .
 5.6  Do I, as an author, have to identify any Reserved Font Names?
 No, but we strongly encourage you to do so. This is to avoid confusion between your work and Modified Versions.
 .
 5.7  Are any names (such as the main font name) reserved by default?
 No. That is a change to the license as of version 1.1. If you want any names to be Reserved Font Names, they must be specified after the copyright statement(s).
 .
 5.8  Is there any situation in which I can use Reserved Font Names for a Modified Version?
 The Copyright Holder(s) can give certain trusted parties the right to use any of the Reserved Font Names through separate written agreements. For example, even if "Foobar" is a RFN, you could write up an agreement to give company "XYZ" the right to distribute a modified version with a name that includes "Foobar". This allows for freedom without confusion.
 .
 5.9  Do font rebuilds require a name change? Do I have to change the name of the font when my packaging workflow includes a full rebuild from source?
 Yes, all rebuilds which change the font data and the smart code are Modified Versions and the requirements of the OFL apply: you need to respect what the Author(s) have chosen in terms of Reserved Font Names. However if a package (or installer) is simply a wrapper or a compressed structure around the final font - leaving them intact on the inside - then no name change is required. Please get in touch with the author(s) and copyright holder(s) to inquire about the presence of font sources beyond the final font file(s) and the recommended build path. That build path may very well be non-trivial and hard to reproduce accurately by the maintainer. If a full font build path is made available by the upstream author(s) please be aware that any regressions and changes you may introduce when doing a rebuild for packaging purposes is your responsibility as a package maintainer since you are effectively creating a separate branch. You should make it very clear to your users that your rebuilt version is not the canonical one from upstream.
 .
 5.10  Can I add other Reserved Font Names when making a derivative font?
 Yes. List your additional Reserved Font Names after your additional copyright statement, as indicated with example placeholders at the top of the OFL.txt file. Be sure you do not remove any exiting RFNs but only add your own.
 .
 .
 6  ABOUT THE FONTLOG
 .
 6.1  What is this FONTLOG thing exactly?
 It has three purposes: 1) to provide basic information on the font to users and other developers, 2) to document changes that have been made to the font or accompanying files, either by the original authors or others, and 3) to provide a place to acknowledge authors and other contributors. Please use it!
 .
 6.2  Is the FONTLOG required?
 It is not a requirement of the license, but we strongly recommend you have one.
 .
 6.3  Am I required to update the FONTLOG when making Modified Versions?
 No, but users, designers and other developers might get very frustrated with you if you don't. People need to know how derivative fonts differ from the original, and how to take advantage of the changes, or build on them. There are utilities that can help create and maintain a FONTLOG, such as the FONTLOG support in FontForge.
 .
 6.4  What should the FONTLOG look like?
 It is typically a separate text file (FONTLOG.txt), but can take other formats. It commonly includes these four sections:
 .
 - brief header describing the FONTLOG itself and name of the font family
 - Basic Font Information - description of the font family, purpose and breadth
 - ChangeLog - chronological listing of changes
 - Acknowledgements - list of authors and contributors with contact information
 .
 It could also include other sections, such as: where to find documentation, how to make contributions, information on contributing organizations, source code details, and a short design guide. See Appendix A for an example FONTLOG.
 .
 .
 7  MAKING CONTRIBUTIONS TO OFL PROJECTS
 .
 7.1  Can I contribute work to OFL projects?
 In many cases, yes. It is common for OFL fonts to be developed by a team of people who welcome contributions from the wider community. Contact the original authors for specific information on how to participate in their projects.
 .
 7.2  Why should I contribute my changes back to the original authors?
 It would benefit many people if you contributed back in response to what you've received. Your contributions and improvements to the fonts and other components could be a tremendous help and would encourage others to contribute as well and 'give back'. You will then benefit from other people's contributions as well. Sometimes maintaining your own separate version takes more effort than merging back with the original. Be aware that any contributions, however, must be either your own original creation or work that you own, and you may be asked to affirm that clearly when you contribute.
 .
 7.3  I've made some very nice improvements to the font. Will you consider adopting them and putting them into future Original Versions?
 Most authors would be very happy to receive such contributions. Keep in mind that it is unlikely that they would want to incorporate major changes that would require additional work on their end. Any contributions would likely need to be made for all the fonts in a family and match the overall design and style. Authors are encouraged to include a guide to the design with the fonts. It would also help to have contributions submitted as patches or clearly marked changes - the use of smart source revision control systems like subversion, svk, mercurial, git or bzr is a good idea. Please follow the recommendations given by the author(s) in terms of preferred source formats and configuration parameters for sending contributions. If this is not indicated in a FONTLOG or other documentation of the font, consider asking them directly. Examples of useful contributions are bug fixes, additional glyphs, stylistic alternates (and the smart font code to access them) or improved hinting. Keep in mind that some kinds of changes (esp. hinting) may be technically difficult to integrate.
 .
 7.4  How can I financially support the development of OFL fonts?
 It is likely that most authors of OFL fonts would accept financial contributions - contact them for instructions on how to do this. Such contributions would support future development. You can also pay for others to enhance the fonts and contribute the results back to the original authors for inclusion in the Original Version.
 .
 .
 8  ABOUT THE LICENSE ITSELF
 .
 8.1  I see that this is version 1.1 of the license. Will there be later changes?
 Version 1.1 is the first minor revision of the OFL. We are confident that version 1.1 will meet most needs, but are open to future improvements. Any revisions would be for future font releases, and previously existing licenses would remain in effect. No retroactive changes are possible, although the Copyright Holder(s) can re-release the font under a revised OFL. All versions will be available on our web site: http://scripts.sil.org/OFL.
 .
 8.2  Does this license restrict the rights of the Copyright Holder(s)?
 No. The Copyright Holder(s) still retain(s) all the rights to their creation; they are only releasing a portion of it for use in a specific way. For example, the Copyright Holder(s) may choose to release a 'basic' version of their font under the OFL, but sell a restricted 'enhanced' version. Only the Copyright Holder(s) can do this.
 .
 8.3  Is the OFL a contract or a license?
 The OFL is a license and not a contract and so does not require you to sign it to have legal validity. By using, modifying and redistributing components under the OFL you indicate that you accept the license.
 .
 8.4  I really like the terms of the OFL, but want to change it a little. Am I allowed to take ideas and actual wording from the OFL and put them into my own custom license for distributing my fonts?
 We strongly recommend against creating your very own unique open licensing model. Using a modified or derivative license will likely cut you off - along with the font(s) under that license - from the community of designers using the OFL, potentially expose you and your users to legal liabilities, and possibly put your work and rights at risk. The OFL went though a community and legal review process that took years of effort, and that review is only applicable to an unmodified OFL. The text of the OFL has been written by SIL (with review and consultation from the community) and is copyright (c) 2005-2010 SIL International. You may re-use the ideas and wording (in part, not in whole) in another non-proprietary license provided that you call your license by another unambiguous name, that you do not use the preamble, that you do not mention SIL and that you clearly present your license as different from the OFL so as not to cause confusion by being too similar to the original. If you feel the OFL does not meet your needs for an open license, please contact us.
 .
 8.5  Can I translate the license and the FAQ into other languages?
 SIL certainly recognises the need for people who are not familiar with English to be able to understand the OFL and its use. Making the license very clear and readable has been a key goal for the OFL, but we know that people understand their own language best.
 .
 If you are an experienced translator, you are very welcome to translate the OFL and OFL-FAQ so that designers and users in your language community can understand the license better. But only the original English version of the license has legal value and has been approved by the community. Translations do not count as legal substitutes and should only serve as a way to explain the original license. SIL - as the author and steward of the license for the community at large - does not approve any translation of the OFL as legally valid because even small translation ambiguities could be abused and create problems.
 .
 SIL gives permission to publish unofficial translations into other languages provided that they comply with the following guidelines:
 .
 - Put the following disclaimer in both English and the target language stating clearly that the translation is unofficial:
 .
 "This is an unofficial translation of the SIL Open Font License into <language_name>. It was not published by SIL International, and does not legally state the distribution terms for fonts that use the OFL. A release under the OFL is only valid when using the original English text. However, we recognize that this unofficial translation will help users and designers not familiar with English to better understand and use the OFL. We encourage designers who consider releasing their creation under the OFL to read the OFL-FAQ in their own language if it is available. Please go to http://scripts.sil.org/OFL for the official version of the license and the accompanying OFL-FAQ."
 .
 - Keep your unofficial translation current and update it at our request if needed, for example if there is any ambiguity which could lead to confusion.  
 .
 If you start such a unofficial translation effort of the OFL and OFL-FAQ please let us know.
 .
 .
 9  ABOUT SIL INTERNATIONAL
 .
 9.1  Who is SIL International and what do they do?
 SIL serves language communities worldwide, building their capacity for sustainable language development, by means of research, translation, training and materials development. SIL makes its services available to all without regard to religious belief, political ideology, gender, race, or ethnic background. SIL's members and volunteers share a Christian commitment.
 .
 9.2  What does this have to do with font licensing?
 The ability to read, write, type and publish in one's own language is one of the most critical needs for millions of people around the world. This requires fonts that are widely available and support lesser-known languages. SIL develops - and encourages others to develop - a complete stack of writing systems implementation components available under open licenses. This open stack includes input methods, smart fonts, smart rendering libraries and smart applications. There has been a need for a common open license that is specifically applicable to fonts and related software (a crucial component of this stack), so SIL developed the SIL Open Font License with the help of the Free/Libre and Open Source Software community.
 .
 9.3  How can I contact SIL?

License: GNU-AGPL
                     GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                        Version 3, 19 November 2007
 .
  Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>
  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
 .
                             Preamble
 .
   The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
 software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure
 cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.
 .
   The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
 to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
 our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to
 share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
 software for all its users.
 .
   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
 price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
 have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
 them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
 want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
 free programs, and that you know you can do these things.
 .
   Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights
 with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer
 you this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
 and/or modify the software.
 .
   A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that
 improvements made in alternate versions of the program, if they
 receive widespread use, become available for other developers to
 incorporate.  Many developers of free software are heartened and
 encouraged by the resulting cooperation.  However, in the case of
 software used on network servers, this result may fail to come about.
 The GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and
 letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its
 source code to the public.
 .
   The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to
 ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available
 to the community.  It requires the operator of a network server to
 provide the source code of the modified version running there to the
 users of that server.  Therefore, public use of a modified version, on
 a publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source
 code of the modified version.
 .
   An older license, called the Affero General Public License and
 published by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals.  This is
 a different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has
 released a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under
 this license.
 .
   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
 modification follow.
 .
                        TERMS AND CONDITIONS
 .
   0. Definitions.
 .
   "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.
 .
   "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
 works, such as semiconductor masks.
 .
   "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
 License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
 "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.
 .
   To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
 in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
 exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
 earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.
 .
   A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
 on the Program.
 .
   To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
 permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
 infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
 computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
 distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
 public, and in some countries other activities as well.
 .
   To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
 parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
 a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
 .
   An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
 to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
 feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
 tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
 extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
 work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
 the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
 menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.
 .
   1. Source Code.
 .
   The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
 for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
 form of a work.
 .
   A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
 standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
 interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
 is widely used among developers working in that language.
 .
   The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
 than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
 packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
 Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
 Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
 implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
 "Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
 (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
 (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
 produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.
 .
   The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
 the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
 work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
 control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
 System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
 programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
 which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
 includes interface definition files associated with source files for
 the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
 linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
 such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
 subprograms and other parts of the work.
 .
   The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
 can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
 Source.
 .
   The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
 same work.
 .
   2. Basic Permissions.
 .
   All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
 copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
 conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
 permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
 covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
 content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
 rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
 .
   You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
 convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
 in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
 of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
 with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
 the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
 not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
 for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
 and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
 your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
 .
   Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
 the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
 makes it unnecessary.
 .
   3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
 .
   No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
 measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
 similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
 measures.
 .
   When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
 circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
 is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
 the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
 modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
 users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
 technological measures.
 .
   4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
 .
   You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
 receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
 appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
 keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
 non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
 keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
 recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.
 .
   You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
 and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.
 .
   5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
 .
   You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
 produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
 terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
 .
     a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
     it, and giving a relevant date.
 .
     b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
     released under this License and any conditions added under section
     7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
     "keep intact all notices".
 .
     c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
     License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
     License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
     additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
     regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
     permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
     invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
 .
     d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
     Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
     interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
     work need not make them do so.
 .
   A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
 works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
 and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
 in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
 "aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
 used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
 beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
 in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
 parts of the aggregate.
 .
   6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
 .
   You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
 of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
 machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
 in one of these ways:
 .
     a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
     (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
     Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
     customarily used for software interchange.
 .
     b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
     (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
     written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
     long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
     model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
     copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
     product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
     medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
     more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
     conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
     Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
 .
     c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
     written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
     alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
     only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
     with subsection 6b.
 .
     d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
     place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
     Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
     further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
     Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
     copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
     may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
     that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
     clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
     Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
     Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
     available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
 .
     e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
     you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
     Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
     charge under subsection 6d.
 .
   A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
 from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
 included in conveying the object code work.
 .
   A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
 tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
 or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
 into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
 doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
 product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
 typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
 of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
 actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
 is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
 commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
 the only significant mode of use of the product.
 .
   "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
 procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
 and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
 a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
 suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
 code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
 modification has been made.
 .
   If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
 specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
 part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
 User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
 fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
 Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
 by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
 if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
 modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
 been installed in ROM).
 .
   The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
 requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
 for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
 the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
 network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
 adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
 protocols for communication across the network.
 .
   Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
 in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
 documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
 source code form), and must require no special password or key for
 unpacking, reading or copying.
 .
   7. Additional Terms.
 .
   "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
 License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
 Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
 be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
 that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
 apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
 under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
 this License without regard to the additional permissions.
 .
   When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
 remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
 it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
 removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
 additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
 for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.
 .
   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
 add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
 that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:
 .
     a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
     terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
 .
     b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
     author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
     Notices displayed by works containing it; or
 .
     c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
     requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
     reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
 .
     d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
     authors of the material; or
 .
     e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
     trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
 .
     f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
     material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
     it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
     any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
     those licensors and authors.
 .
   All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
 restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
 received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
 governed by this License along with a term that is a further
 restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
 a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
 License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
 of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
 not survive such relicensing or conveying.
 .
   If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
 must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
 additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
 where to find the applicable terms.
 .
   Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
 form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
 the above requirements apply either way.
 .
   8. Termination.
 .
   You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
 provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
 modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
 this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
 paragraph of section 11).
 .
   However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
 license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
 provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
 finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
 holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
 prior to 60 days after the cessation.
 .
   Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
 reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
 violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
 received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
 copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
 your receipt of the notice.
 .
   Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
 licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
 this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
 reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
 material under section 10.
 .
   9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
 .
   You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
 run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
 occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
 to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
 nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
 modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
 not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
 covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.
 .
   10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
 .
   Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
 receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
 propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
 for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
 .
   An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
 organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
 organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
 work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
 transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
 licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
 give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
 Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
 the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.
 .
   You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
 rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
 not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
 rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
 (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
 any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
 sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.
 .
   11. Patents.
 .
   A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
 License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
 work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".
 .
   A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
 owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
 hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
 by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
 but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
 consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
 purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
 patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
 this License.
 .
   Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
 patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
 make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
 propagate the contents of its contributor version.
 .
   In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
 agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
 (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
 sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
 party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
 patent against the party.
 .
   If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
 and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
 to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
 publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
 then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
 available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
 patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
 consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
 license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
 actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
 covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
 in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
 country that you have reason to believe are valid.
 .
   If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
 arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
 covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
 receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
 or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
 you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
 work and works based on it.
 .
   A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
 the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
 conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
 specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
 work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
 in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
 to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
 the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
 parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
 patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
 conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
 for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
 contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
 or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
 .
   Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
 any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
 otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.
 .
   12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.
 .
   If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
 otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
 excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
 covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
 License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
 not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
 to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
 the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
 License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.
 .
   13. Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License.
 .
   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the
 Program, your modified version must prominently offer all users
 interacting with it remotely through a computer network (if your version
 supports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding
 Source of your version by providing access to the Corresponding Source
 from a network server at no charge, through some standard or customary
 means of facilitating copying of software.  This Corresponding Source
 shall include the Corresponding Source for any work covered by version 3
 of the GNU General Public License that is incorporated pursuant to the
 following paragraph.
 .
   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
 permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
 under version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single
 combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
 License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
 but the work with which it is combined will remain governed by version
 3 of the GNU General Public License.
 .
   14. Revised Versions of this License.
 .
   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
 the GNU Affero General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions
 will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
 address new problems or concerns.
 .
   Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
 Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero General
 Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
 option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
 version or of any later version published by the Free Software
 Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
 GNU Affero General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
 by the Free Software Foundation.
 .
   If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
 versions of the GNU Affero General Public License can be used, that proxy's
 public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
 to choose that version for the Program.
 .
   Later license versions may give you additional or different
 permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
 author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
 later version.
 .
   15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
 .
   THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
 APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
 HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
 OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
 THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
 PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
 IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
 ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
 .
   16. Limitation of Liability.
 .
   IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
 WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
 THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
 GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
 USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
 DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
 PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
 EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
 SUCH DAMAGES.
 .
   17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
 .
   If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
 above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
 reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
 an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
 Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
 copy of the Program in return for a fee.
 .
                      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
 .
             How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
 .
   If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
 possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
 free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
 .
   To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
 to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
 state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
 the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
 .
     <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
     Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
 .
     This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
     it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as published by
     the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
     (at your option) any later version.
 .
     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
     GNU Affero General Public License for more details.
 .
     You should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General Public License
     along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
 .
 Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
 .
   If your software can interact with users remotely through a computer
 network, you should also make sure that it provides a way for users to
 get its source.  For example, if your program is a web application, its
 interface could display a "Source" link that leads users to an archive
 of the code.  There are many ways you could offer source, and different
 solutions will be better for different programs; see section 13 for the
 specific requirements.
 .
   You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
 if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.
