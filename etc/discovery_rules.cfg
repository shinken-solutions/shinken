##### Here are some examples for tagging hosts with classic templates

# Classic Network services


define discoveryrule {
       discoveryrule_name       Ssh
       creation_type            host
       openports                ^22$
       +use                     ssh
}








# The generic-host should be AT THE END, because templates are built from more specific to
# generic
define discoveryrule {
       discoveryrule_name	HostGeneric
       creation_type		host
       isup			1
       +use			generic-host
}





# Example for service creation.
# Obviously the 77777 port is not valid :)
# This shows how to create a service with a rule

define discoveryrule {
       discoveryrule_name       Sample-Service
       openports                ^77777$
       check_command            check_dummy
       service_description      Sample-Service
       use                      generic-service
}
