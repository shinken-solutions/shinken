# ARBITER
#===============================================================================
# Description: The Arbiter is responsible for:
# - Loading, manipulating and dispatching the configuration
# - Validating the health of all other Shinken daemons
# - Issuing global directives to Shinken daemons (kill, activate-spare, etc.)
# https://shinken.readthedocs.org/en/latest/08_configobjects/arbiter.html
#===============================================================================
# IMPORTANT: If you use several arbiters you MUST set the host_name on each
# servers to its real DNS name ('hostname' command).
