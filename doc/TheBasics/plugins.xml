  <title>Nagios Plugins</title>

  <section>
    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>Unlike many other monitoring tools, Nagios does not include any
    internal mechanisms for checking the status of hosts and services on your
    network. Instead, Nagios relies on external programs (called plugins) to
    do all the dirty work.</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>What Are Plugins?</title>

    <para>Plugins are compiled executables or scripts (Perl scripts, shell
    scripts, etc.) that can be run from a command line to check the status or
    a host or service. Nagios uses the results from plugins to determine the
    current status of hosts and services on your network.</para>

    <para>Nagios will execute a plugin whenever there is a need to check the
    status of a service or host. The plugin does something (notice the very
    general term) to perform the check and then simply returns the results to
    Nagios. Nagios will process the results that it receives from the plugin
    and take any necessary actions (running <link
    linkend="advancedtopics-eventhandlers">event handlers</link>, sending out
    <link linkend="thebasics-notifications">notifications</link>, etc).</para>

    <title>Plugins As An Abstraction Layer</title>

    <para><informalfigure>
	<mediaobject>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata fileref="images/plugins.png" format="PNG"/>
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject></informalfigure>Plugins act as an abstraction layer between the
    monitoring logic present in the Nagios daemon and the actual services and
    hosts that are being monitored.</para>

    <para>The upside of this type of plugin architecture is that you can
    monitor just about anything you can think of. If you can automate the
    process of checking something, you can monitor it with Nagios. There are
    already a lot of plugins that have been created in order to monitor basic
    resources such as processor load, disk usage, ping rates, etc. If you want
    to monitor something else, take a look at the documentation on <link
    linkend="development-pluginapi">writing plugins</link> and roll your own.
    Its simple!</para>

    <para>The downside to this type of plugin architecture is the fact that
    Nagios has absolutely no idea what it is that you're monitoring. You could
    be monitoring network traffic statistics, data error rates, room
    temperate, CPU voltage, fan speed, processor load, disk space, or the
    ability of your super-fantastic toaster to properly brown your bread in
    the morning... Nagios doesn't understand the specifics of what's being
    monitored - it just tracks changes in the state of those resources. Only
    the plugins themselves know exactly what they're monitoring and how to
    perform the actual checks.</para>

    <para>There are plugins currently available to monitor many different
    kinds of devices and services, including:</para>

    <title>Obtaining Plugins</title>

    <para>Plugins are not distributed with Nagios, but you can download the
    official Nagios plugins and many additional plugins created and maintained
    by Nagios users from the following locations:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Nagios Plugins Project: <ulink
        url="http://nagiosplug.sourceforge.net/">http://nagiosplug.sourceforge.net/</ulink></para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Nagios Downloads Page: <ulink

  <section>
    <title>How Do I Use Plugin X?</title>

    <para>Most all plugins will display basic usage information when you
    execute them using <option>-h</option> or <option>--help</option> on the
    command line. For example, if you want to know how the
    <command>check_http</command> plugin works or what options it accepts, you
    should try executing the following command:

    <command>./check_http --help</command></para>
  </section>

    <para>You can find information on the technical aspects of plugins, as
    well as how to go about creating your own custom plugins <link
