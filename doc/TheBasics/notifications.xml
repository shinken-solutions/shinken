      </inlinemediaobject> I've had a lot of questions as to exactly how
    notifications work. This will attempt to explain exactly when and how host
    and service notifications are sent out, as well as who receives
    them.</para>

    <para>Notification escalations are explained <link

  <section>
    <title>When Do Notifications Occur?</title>

    <para>The decision to send out notifications is made in the service check
    and host check logic. Host and service notifications occur in the
    following instances...</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>When a hard state change occurs. More information on state types
        and hard state changes can be found <link
        linkend="thebasics-statetypes">here</link>.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>When a host or service remains in a hard non-OK state and the
        time specified by the &lt;notification_interval&gt; option in the host
        or service definition has passed since the last notification was sent
        out (for that specified host or service).</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Who Gets Notified?</title>

    <para>Each host and service definition has a
    &lt;<code>contact_groups</code>&gt; option that specifies what contact
    groups receive notifications for that particular host or service. Contact
    groups can contain one or more individual contacts.</para>

    <para>When Nagios sends out a host or service notification, it will notify
    each contact that is a member of any contact groups specified in the
    &lt;<code>contactgroups</code>&gt; option of the service definition.
    Nagios realizes that a contact may be a member of more than one contact
    group, so it removes duplicate contact notifications before it does
    anything.</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>What Filters Must Be Passed In Order For Notifications To Be
    Sent?</title>

    <para>Just because there is a need to send out a host or service
    notification doesn't mean that any contacts are going to get notified.
    There are several filters that potential notifications must pass before
    they are deemed worthy enough to be sent out. Even then, specific contacts
    may not be notified if their notification filters do not allow for the
    notification to be sent to them. Let's go into the filters that have to be
    passed in more detail...</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Program-Wide Filter:</title>

    <para>The first filter that notifications must pass is a test of whether
    or not notifications are enabled on a program-wide basis. This is
    initially determined by the <link linkend="configuringnagios-configmain-enable_notifications"><code>enable_notifications</code></link> directive in the main
    config file, but may be changed during runtime from the web interface. If
    notifications are disabled on a program-wide basis, no host or service
    notifications can be sent out - period. If they are enabled on a
    program-wide basis, there are still other tests that must be
    passed...</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Service and Host Filters:</title>

    <para>The first filter for host or service notifications is a check to see
    if the host or service is in a period of <link
    linkend="advancedtopics-downtime">scheduled downtime</link>. It it is in a
    scheduled downtime, no one gets notified. If it isn't in a period of
    downtime, it gets passed on to the next filter. As a side note,
    notifications for services are suppressed if the host they're associated
    with is in a period of scheduled downtime.</para>

    <para>The second filter for host or service notification is a check to see
    if the host or service is <link
    linkend="advancedtopics-flapping">flapping</link> (if you enabled flap
    detection). If the service or host is currently flapping, no one gets
    notified. Otherwise it gets passed to the next filter.</para>

    <para>The third host or service filter that must be passed is the host- or
    service-specific notification options. Each service definition contains
    options that determine whether or not notifications can be sent out for
    warning states, critical states, and recoveries. Similiarly, each host
    definition contains options that determine whether or not notifications
    can be sent out when the host goes down, becomes unreachable, or recovers.
    If the host or service notification does not pass these options, no one
    gets notified. If it does pass these options, the notification gets passed
    to the next filter...</para>

    <note>
      <para>Notifications about host or service recoveries are only sent out
      if a notification was sent out for the original problem. It doesn't make
      sense to get a recovery notification for something you never knew was a
      problem.</para>
    </note>

    <para>The fourth host or service filter that must be passed is the time
    period test. Each host and service definition has a
    &lt;<code>notification_period</code>&gt; option that specifies which time
    period contains valid notification times for the host or service. If the
    time that the notification is being made does not fall within a valid time
    range in the specified time period, no one gets contacted. If it falls
    within a valid time range, the notification gets passed to the next
    filter...</para>

    <note>
      <para>If the time period filter is not passed, Nagios will reschedule
      the next notification for the host or service (if its in a non-OK state)
      for the next valid time present in the time period. This helps ensure
      that contacts are notified of problems as soon as possible when the next
      valid time in time period arrives.</para>
    </note>

    <para>The last set of host or service filters is conditional upon two
    things: (1) a notification was already sent out about a problem with the
    host or service at some point in the past and (2) the host or service has
    remained in the same non-OK state that it was when the last notification
    went out. If these two criteria are met, then Nagios will check and make
    sure the time that has passed since the last notification went out either
    meets or exceeds the value specified by the
    &lt;<code>notification_interval</code>&gt; option in the host or service
    definition. If not enough time has passed since the last notification, no
    one gets contacted. If either enough time has passed since the last
    notification or the two criteria for this filter were not met, the
    notification will be sent out! Whether or not it actually is sent to
    individual contacts is up to another set of filters...</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Contact Filters:</title>

    <para>At this point the notification has passed the program mode filter
    and all host or service filters and Nagios starts to notify <link
    linkend="configuringnagios-objectdefinitions-contact">all the people it should</link>.
    Does this mean that each contact is going to receive the notification? No!
    Each contact has their own set of filters that the notification must pass
    before they receive it.</para>

    <note>
      <para>Contact filters are specific to each contact and do not affect
      whether or not other contacts receive notifications.</para>
    </note>

    <para>The first filter that must be passed for each contact are the
    notification options. Each contact definition contains options that
    determine whether or not service notifications can be sent out for warning
    states, critical states, and recoveries. Each contact definition also
    contains options that determine whether or not host notifications can be
    sent out when the host goes down, becomes unreachable, or recovers. If the
    host or service notification does not pass these options, the contact will
    not be notified. If it does pass these options, the notification gets
    passed to the next filter...</para>

    <note>
      <para>Notifications about host or service recoveries are only sent out
      if a notification was sent out for the original problem. It doesn't make
      sense to get a recovery notification for something you never knew was a
      problem...</para>
    </note>

    <para>The last filter that must be passed for each contact is the time
    period test. Each contact definition has a
    &lt;<code>notification_period</code>&gt; option that specifies which time
    period contains valid notification times for the contact. If the time that
    the notification is being made does not fall within a valid time range in
    the specified time period, the contact will not be notified. If it falls
    within a valid time range, the contact gets notified!</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Notification Methods</title>

    <para>You can have Nagios notify you of problems and recoveries pretty
    much anyway you want: pager, cellphone, email, instant message, audio
    alert, electric shocker, etc. How notifications are sent depend on the
    <link linkend="configuringnagios-objectdefinitions-command">notification commands</link>
    that are defined in your <link linkend="configuringnagios-config">object definition
    files</link>.</para>

    <note>
      <para>If you install Nagios according to the <link
      linkend="gettingstarted-quickstart">quickstart guide</link>, it should
      be configured to send email notifications. You can see the email
      notification commands that are used by viewing the contents of the
      following file:
      <filename>/usr/local/nagios/etc/objects/commands.cfg</filename>.</para>
    </note>

    <para>Specific notification methods (paging, etc.) are not directly
    incorporated into the Nagios code as it just doesn't make much sense. The
    "core" of Nagios is not designed to be an all-in-one application. If
    service checks were embedded in Nagios' core it would be very difficult
    for users to add new check methods, modify existing checks, etc.
    Notifications work in a similiar manner. There are a thousand different
    ways to do notifications and there are already a lot of packages out there
    that handle the dirty work, so why re-invent the wheel and limit yourself
    to a bike tire? Its much easier to let an external entity (i.e. a simple
    script or a full-blown messaging system) do the messy stuff. Some
    messaging packages that can handle notifications for pagers and cellphones
    are listed below in the resource section.</para>

    <title>Notification Type Macro</title>

    <para>When crafting your notification commands, you need to take into
    account what type of notification is occurring. The <link
    linkend="thebasics-macrolist-notificationtype">$NOTIFICATIONTYPE$</link> macro contains a string that
    identifies exactly that. The table below lists the possible values for the
    macro and their respective descriptions:</para>

    <title>Helpful Resources</title>

    <para>There are many ways you could configure Nagios to send notifications
    out. Its up to you to decide which method(s) you want to use. Once you do
    that you'll have to install any necessary software and configure
    notification commands in your config files before you can use them. Here
    are just a few possible notification methods:</para>

      <listitem>
        <para>etc...</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>Basically anything you can do from a command line can be tailored
    for use as a notification command.</para>

    <para>If you're looking for an alternative to using email for sending
    messages to your pager or cellphone, check out these packages. They could
    be used in conjuction with Nagios to send out a notification via a modem
    when a problem arises. That way you don't have to rely on email to send
    notifications out (remember, email may *not* work if there are network
    problems). I haven't actually tried these packages myself, but others have
    reported success using them...</para>
