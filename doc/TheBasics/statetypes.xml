  <title>State Types</title>

  <section>
    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>The current state of monitored services and hosts is determined by
    two components:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>The status of the service or host (i.e. OK, WARNING, UP, DOWN,
        etc.)</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Tye type of state the service or host is in</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>There are two state types in Nagios - SOFT states and HARD states.
    These state types are a crucial part of the monitoring logic, as they are
    used to determine when <link linkend="advancedtopics-eventhandlers">event
    handlers</link> are executed and when <link
    linkend="thebasics-notifications">notifications</link> are initially sent
    out.</para>

    <para>This document describes the difference between SOFT and HARD states,
    how they occur, and what happens when they occur.</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Service and Host Check Retries</title>

    <para>In order to prevent false alarms from transient problems, Nagios
    allows you to define how many times a service or host should be
    (re)checked before it is considered to have a "real" problem. This is
    controlled by the max_check_attempts option in the host and service
    definitions. Understanding how hosts and services are (re)checked in order
    to determine if a real problem exists is important in understanding how
    state types work.</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Soft States</title>

    <para>Soft states occur in the following situations...</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>When a service or host check results in a non-OK or non-UP state
        and the service check has not yet been (re)checked the number of times
        specified by the max_check_attempts directive in the service or host
        definition. This is called a soft error.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>When a service or host recovers from a soft error. This is
        considered a soft recovery.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>The following things occur when hosts or services experience SOFT
    state changes:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>The SOFT state is logged.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Event handlers are executed to handle the SOFT state.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>SOFT states are only logged if you enabled the <link
    linkend="configuringnagios-configmain-log_service_retries">log_service_retries</link>
    or <link
    linkend="configuringnagios-configmain-log_host_retries">log_host_retries</link>
    options in your main configuration file.</para>

    <para>The only important thing that really happens during a soft state is
    the execution of event handlers. Using event handlers can be particularly
    useful if you want to try and proactively fix a problem before it turns
    into a HARD state. The <link
    linkend="thebasics-macrolist-hoststatetype">$HOSTSTATETYPE$</link> or
    <link
    linkend="thebasics-macrolist-servicestatetype">$SERVICESTATETYPE$</link>
    macros will have a value of "SOFT" when event handlers are executed, which
    allows your event handler scripts to know when they should take corrective
    action. More information on event handlers can be found <link
    linkend="advancedtopics-eventhandlers">here</link>.</para>

  <section>
    <title>Hard States</title>

    <para>Hard states occur for hosts and services in the following
    situations:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>When a host or service check results in a non-UP or non-OK state
        and it has been (re)checked the number of times specified by the
        max_check_attempts option in the host or service definition. This is a
        hard error state.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>When a host or service transitions from one hard error state to
        another error state (e.g. WARNING to CRITICAL).</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>When a service check results in a non-OK state and its
        corresponding host is either DOWN or UNREACHABLE.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>When a host or service recovers from a hard error state. This is
        considered to be a hard recovery.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>When a <link linkend="thebasics-passivechecks">passive host
        check</link> is received. Passive host checks are treated as HARD
        unless the <link
        linkend="configuringnagios-configmain-passive_host_checks_are_soft">passive_host_checks_are_soft</link>
        option is enabled.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>The following things occur when hosts or services experience HARD
    state changes:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>The HARD state is logged.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Event handlers are executed to handle the HARD state.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Contacts are notifified of the host or service problem or
        recovery.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>The <link
    linkend="thebasics-macrolist-hoststatetype">$HOSTSTATETYPE$</link> or
    <link
    linkend="thebasics-macrolist-servicestatetype">$SERVICESTATETYPE$</link>
    macros will have a value of "HARD" when event handlers are executed, which
    allows your event handler scripts to know when they should take corrective
    action. More information on event handlers can be found <link
    linkend="advancedtopics-eventhandlers">here</link>.</para>

  <section>
    <title>Example</title>

    <para>Here's an example of how state types are determined, when state
    changes occur, and when event handlers and notifications are sent out. The
    table below shows consecutive checks of a service over time. The service
    has a max_check_attempts value of 3.</para>
