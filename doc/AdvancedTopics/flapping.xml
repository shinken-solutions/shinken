    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>Nagios supports optional detection of hosts and services that are
    <quote>flapping</quote>. Flapping occurs when a service or host changes state too
    frequently, resulting in a storm of problem and recovery notifications.
    Flapping can be indicative of configuration problems (i.e. thresholds set
    too low), troublesome services, or real network problems.</para>

    <title>How Flap Detection Works</title>

    <para>Before I get into this, let me say that flapping detection has been
    a little difficult to implement. How exactly does one determine what "too
    frequently" means in regards to state changes for a particular host or
    service? When I first started thinking about implementing flap detection I
    tried to find some information on how flapping could/should be detected. I
    couldn't find any information about what others were using (where they
    using any?), so I decided to settle with what seemed to me to be a
    reasonable solution...</para>

    <para>Whenever Nagios checks the status of a host or service, it will
    check to see if it has started or stopped flapping. It does this
    by.</para>

    <para>A host or service is determined to have started flapping when its
    percent state change first exceeds a high flapping threshold.</para>

    <para>A host or service is determined to have stopped flapping when its
    percent state goes below a low flapping threshold (assuming that is was
    previously flapping).</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Example</title>

    <para>Let's describe in more detail how flap detection works with
    services...</para>

    <para>The image below shows a chronological history of service states from
    the most recent 21 service checks. OK states are shown in green, WARNING
    states in yellow, CRITICAL states in red, and UNKNOWN states in
    orange.</para>

    <para><informalfigure><mediaobject>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata fileref="images/statetransitions.png" format="PNG"/>
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject></informalfigure></para>

    <para>The historical service check results are examined to determine where
    state changes/transitions occur. State changes occur when an archived
    state is different from the archived state that immediately precedes it
    chronologically. Since we keep the results of the last 21 service checks
    in the array, there is a possibility of having at most 20 state changes.
    In this example there are 7 state changes, indicated by blue arrows in the
    image above.</para>

    <para>The flap detection logic uses the state changes to determine an
    overall percent state change for the service. This is a measure of
    volatility/change for the service. Services that never change state will
    have a 0% state change value, while services that change state each time
    they're checked will have 100% state change. Most services will have a
    percent state change somewhere in between.</para>

    <para>When calculating the percent state change for the service, the flap
    detection algorithm will give more weight to new state changes compare to
    older ones. Specfically, the flap detection routines are currently
    designed to make the newest possible state change carry 50% more weight
    than the oldest possible state change. The image below shows how recent
    state changes are given more weight than older state changes when
    calculating the overall or total percent state change for a particular
    service.</para>

    <para><informalfigure><mediaobject>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata fileref="images/statetransitions2.png" format="PNG"/>
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject></informalfigure></para>

    <para>Using the images above, lets do a calculation of percent state
    change for the service. You will notice that there are a total of 7 state
    changes (at t3, t4, t5, t9, t12, t16, and t19). Without any weighting of
    the state changes over time, this would give us a total state change of
    35%:</para>

    <para>(7 observed state changes / possible 20 state changes) * 100 = 35
    %</para>

    <para>Since the flap detection logic will give newer state changes a
    higher rate than older state changes, the actual calculated percent state
    change will be slightly less than 35% in this example. Let's say that the
    weighted percent of state change turned out to be 31%...</para>

    <para>The calculated percent state change for the service (31%) will then
    be compared against flapping thresholds to see what should happen:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>If the service was not previously flapping and 31% is equal to
        or greater than the high flap threshold, Nagios considers the service
        to have just started flapping.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>If the service was previously flapping and 31% is less than the
        low flap threshold, Nagios considers the service to have just stopped
        flapping.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>If neither of those two conditions are met, the flap detection logic
    won't do anything else with the service, since it is either not currently
    flapping or it is still flapping.</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Flap Detection for Services</title>

    <para>Nagios checks to see if a service is flapping whenever the service
    is checked (either actively or passively).</para>

    <para>The flap detection logic for services works as described in the
    example above.</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Flap Detection for Hosts</title>

    <para>Host flap detection works in a similiar manner to service flap
    detection, with one important difference: Nagios will attempt to check to
    see if a host is flapping whenever:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>The host is checked (actively or passively)</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Sometimes when a service associated with that host is checked.
        More specifically, when at least x amount of time has passed since the
        flap detection was last performed, where x is equal to the average
        check interval of all services associated with the host.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>Why is this done? With services we know that the minimum amount of
    time between consecutive flap detection routines is going to be equal to
    the service check interval. However, you might not be monitoring hosts on
    a regular basis, so there might not be a host check interval that can be
    used in the flap detection logic. Also, it makes sense that checking a
    service should count towards the detection of host flapping. Services are
    attributes of or things associated with host after all... At any rate,
    that's the best method I could come up with for determining how often flap
    detection could be performed on a host, so there you have it.</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Flap Detection Thresholds</title>

    <para>Nagios uses several variables to determine the percent state change
    thresholds is uses for flap detection. For both hosts and services, there
    are global high and low thresholds and host- or service-specific
    thresholds that you can configure. Nagios will use the global thresholds
    for flap detection if you to not specify host- or service- specific
    thresholds.</para>

    <para>The table below shows the global and host- or service-specific
    variables that control the various thresholds used in flap
    detection.</para>

  <section>
    <title>States Used For Flap Detection</title>

    <para>Normally Nagios will track the results of the last 21 checks of a
    host or service, regardless of the check result (host/service state), for
    use in the flap detection logic.</para>

    <tip>
      <para>You can exclude certain host or service states from use in flap
      detection logic by using the <varname>flap_detection_options</varname> directive in your
      host or service definitions. This directive allows you to specify what
      host or service states (i.e. "UP, "DOWN", "OK, "CRITICAL") you want to
      use for flap detection. If you don't use this directive, all host or
      service states are used in flap detection.</para>
    </tip>

  <section>
    <title>Flap Handling</title>

    <para>When a service or host is first detected as flapping, Nagios
    will:</para>

    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Log a message indicating that the service or host is
        flapping.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Add a non-persistent comment to the host or service indicating
        that it is flapping.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Send a "flapping start" notification for the host or service to
        appropriate contacts.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Suppress other notifications for the service or host (this is
        one of the filters in the <link
        linkend="thebasics-notifications">notification logic</link>).</para>
      </listitem>
    </orderedlist>

    <para>When a service or host stops flapping, Nagios will:</para>

      <listitem>
        <para>Log a message indicating that the service or host has stopped
        flapping.</para>

      <listitem>
        <para>Remove the block on notifications for the service or host
        (notifications will still be bound to the normal <link

    <title>Enabling Flap Detection</title>

    <para>In order to enable the flap detection features in Nagios, you'll
    need to:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Set <link
        linkend="configuringnagios-configmain-enable_flap_detection">enable_flap_detection</link>
        directive is set to 1.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Set the <varname>flap_detection_enabled</varname> directive in
        your host and service definitions is set to 1.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>If you want to disable flap detection on a global basis, set the
    <link
    linkend="configuringnagios-configmain-enable_flap_detection">enable_flap_detection</link>
    directive to 0.</para>

    <para>If you would like to disable flap detection for just a few hosts or
    services, use the <varname>flap_detection_enabled</varname> directive in the host and/or
    service definitions to do so.</para>
