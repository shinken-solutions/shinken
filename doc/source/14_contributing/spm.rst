========================
Shinken Package Manager
========================

.. important::  I don't now how you get here :)  it's a poc of the design of a shinken pack manager. A pack can be a module, a configuration pack or what ever you want.

A pack can be about :
  * configuration
  * module

Each pack should have a pack.json file that describe it.

  
::
  
  {
      "name": "linux",
      "version": "1.2",
      "description": "Standard linux checks, like CPU, RAM and disk space. Checks are done by SNMP.",
      "type": "configuration",
      "dependencies": {
          "shinken" : ">1.2"
      },
      "repository": {
          "type": "git",
          "url": "git://github.com/naparuba/pack-cfg-linux.git"
      },
      "keywords": [
          "linux", "snmp"
      ],
      "author": "Jean Gab√®s <naparuba@gmail.com>",
      "license": "Affero GPLv3",
      "configuration":{
          "path":"os/",
          "macros":{
              "_SNMPCOMMUNITY": {
                  "type":"string",
                  "description":"The read snmp community allowed on the linux server"
              },
          }
      }
  }


And for a module one :

  
::
  
  {
      "name": "logstore_mongodb",
      "version": "1.2",
      "description": "Log store module for LiveStatus. Will save the logs into Mongodb.",
      "type": "module",
      "dependencies": {
          "shinken" : ">1.2",
          "livestatus" : ">1.2"
      },
      "repository": {
          "type": "git",
          "url": "git://github.com/naparuba/pack-module-logstore_mongodb.git"
      },
      "keywords": [
          "mongodb", "log", "livestatus"
      ],
      "author": "Gerhard Lausser <>",
      "license": "Affero GPLv3"
  }


The spm command should be really simple to use.

  
::
   spm install linux
   
This will download the linux pack and put the good files into the rigth place.

  
::
  spm search linux
  
This will output all the pack with linux in the name or the description.

  
::
  spm create
  
This will create a .tar.gz file with all inside.

  
::
  spm publish
  
This will push the .tar.gz file to the registry.shinken-montioring.org website. Will use the ~/.spm/api.key for credentials.

  
::
  spm adduser
  
This will try to register you to the registry website. If the username you propose is already defined, propose you to login and get your API key.
