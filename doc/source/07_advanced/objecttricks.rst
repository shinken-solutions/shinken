Time-Saving Tricks For Object Definitions 
==========================================

**Abstract**

or..."How To Preserve Your Sanity"


Introduction 
=============

This documentation attempts to explain how you can exploit the (somewhat) hidden features of :ref:`template-based object definitions <configuration/objectdefinitions>` to save your sanity. How so, you ask? Several types of objects allow you to specify multiple host names and/or hostgroup names in definitions, allowing you to "copy" the object definition to multiple hosts or services. I'll cover each type of object that supports these features separately. For starters, the object types which support this time-saving feature are as follows:

  * :ref:`Services <advanced/objecttricks#service>`
  * :ref:`Service escalations <advanced/objecttricks#serviceescalation>`
  * :ref:`Service dependencies <advanced/objecttricks#servicedependency>`
  * :ref:`Host escalations <advanced/objecttricks#hostescalation>`
  * :ref:`Host dependencies <advanced/objecttricks#hostdependency>`
  * :ref:`Hostgroups <advanced/objecttricks#hostgroup>`

Object types that are not listed above (i.e. timeperiods, commands, etc.) do not support the features I'm about to describe.

Service Definitions 
====================


Multiple Hosts: 
----------------

If you want to create identical :ref:`services <configobjects/service>` that are assigned to multiple hosts, you can specify multiple hosts in the "host_name" directive. The definition below would create a service called SOMESERVICE on hosts HOST1 through HOSTN. All the instances of the SOMESERVICE service would be identical (i.e. have the same check command, max check attempts, notification period, etc.).

  
::

  define service{
      host_name                HOST1,HOST2,HOST3,...,HOSTN
      service_description      SOMESERVICE
      other service directives ...
  }


All Hosts In Multiple Hostgroups: 
----------------------------------

If you want to create identical services that are assigned to all hosts in one or more hostgroups, you can do so by creating a single service definition. How ? The "hostgroup_name" directive allows you to specify the name of one or more hostgroups that the service should be created for. The definition below would create a service called SOMESERVICE on all hosts that are members of hostgroups HOSTGROUP1 through HOSTGROUPN. All the instances of the SOMESERVICE service would be identical (i.e. have the same check command, max check attempts, notification period, etc.).

  
::

  define service{
      hostgroup_name          HOSTGROUP1,HOSTGROUP2,...,HOSTGROUPN
      service_description     SOMESERVICE
      other service directives ...
  }


All Hosts: 
-----------

If you want to create identical services that are assigned to all hosts that are defined in your configuration files, you can use a wildcard in the "host_name" directive. The definition below would create a service called SOMESERVICE on all hosts that are defined in your configuration files. All the instances of the SOMESERVICE service would be identical (i.e. have the same check command, max check attempts, notification period, etc.).

  
::

  define service{
      host_name               *
      service_description     SOMESERVICE
      other service directives ...
  }


Excluding Hosts: 
-----------------

If you want to create identical services on numerous hosts or hostgroups, but would like to exclude some hosts from the definition, this can be accomplished by preceding the host or hostgroup with a ! symbol.

  
::

  define service{
      host_name             HOST1,HOST2,!HOST3,!HOST4,...,HOSTN
      hostgroup_name        HOSTGROUP1,HOSTGROUP2,!HOSTGROUP3,!HOSTGROUP4,...,HOSTGROUPN
      service_description   SOMESERVICE
      other service directives ...
  }
  


.. _advanced/objecttricks#serviceescalation:

Service Escalation Definitions 
===============================


Multiple Hosts: 
----------------

If you want to create :ref:`service escalations <configobjects/serviceescalation>` for services of the same name/description that are assigned to multiple hosts, you can specify multiple hosts in the "host_name" directive. The definition below would create a service escalation for services called SOMESERVICE on hosts HOST1 through HOSTN. All the instances of the service escalation would be identical (i.e. have the same contact groups, notification interval, etc.).

  
::

  define serviceescalation{
      host_name               HOST1,HOST2,HOST3,...,HOSTN
      service_description     SOMESERVICE
      other escalation directives ...
  }


All Hosts In Multiple Hostgroups: 
----------------------------------

If you want to create service escalations for services of the same name/description that are assigned to all hosts in in one or more hostgroups, you can do use the "hostgroup_name" directive. The definition below would create a service escalation for services called SOMESERVICE on all hosts that are members of hostgroups HOSTGROUP1 through HOSTGROUPN. All the instances of the service escalation would be identical (i.e. have the same contact groups, notification interval, etc.).

  
::

  define serviceescalation{
      hostgroup_name          HOSTGROUP1,HOSTGROUP2,...,HOSTGROUPN
      service_description     SOMESERVICE
      other escalation directives ...
  }


All Hosts: 
-----------

If you want to create identical service escalations for services of the same name/description that are assigned to all hosts that are defined in your configuration files, you can use a wildcard in the "host_name" directive. The definition below would create a service escalation for all services called SOMESERVICE on all hosts that are defined in your configuration files. All the instances of the service escalation would be identical (i.e. have the same contact groups, notification interval, etc.).

  
::

  define serviceescalation{
      host_name               *
      service_description     SOMESERVICE
      other escalation directives ...
  }


Excluding Hosts: 
-----------------

If you want to create identical services escalations for services on numerous hosts or hostgroups, but would like to exclude some hosts from the definition, this can be accomplished by preceding the host or hostgroup with a ! symbol.

  
::

  define serviceescalation{
      host_name             HOST1,HOST2,!HOST3,!HOST4,...,HOSTN
      hostgroup_name        HOSTGROUP1,HOSTGROUP2,!HOSTGROUP3,!HOSTGROUP4,...,HOSTGROUPN
      service_description   SOMESERVICE
      other escalation directives ...
  }


All Services On Same Host: 
---------------------------

If you want to create :ref:`service escalations <configobjects/serviceescalation>` for all services assigned to a particular host, you can use a wildcard in the "service_description" directive. The definition below would create a service escalation for all services on host HOST1. All the instances of the service escalation would be identical (i.e. have the same contact groups, notification interval, etc.).

If you feel like being particularly adventurous, you can specify a wildcard in both the "host_name" and "service_description" directives. Doing so would create a service escalation for all services that you've defined in your configuration files.

  
::

  define serviceescalation{
      host_name               HOST1
      service_description     *
      other escalation directives ...
  }


Multiple Services On Same Host: 
--------------------------------

If you want to create :ref:`service escalations <configobjects/serviceescalation>` for all multiple services assigned to a particular host, you can use a specify more than one service description in the "service_description" directive. The definition below would create a service escalation for services SERVICE1 through SERVICEN on host HOST1. All the instances of the service escalation would be identical (i.e. have the same contact groups, notification interval, etc.).

  
::

  define serviceescalation{
      host_name               HOST1
      service_description     SERVICE1,SERVICE2,...,SERVICEN
      other escalation directives ...
  }


All Services In Multiple Servicegroups: 
----------------------------------------

If you want to create service escalations for all services that belong in one or more servicegroups, you can do use the "servicegroup_name" directive. The definition below would create service escalations for all services that are members of servicegroups SERVICEGROUP1 through SERVICEGROUPN. All the instances of the service escalation would be identical (i.e. have the same contact groups, notification interval, etc.).

  
::

  define serviceescalation{
      servicegroup_name          SERVICEGROUP1,SERVICEGROUP2,...,SERVICEGROUPN
      other escalation directives ...
  }
  


.. _advanced/objecttricks#servicedependency:

Service Dependency Definitions 
===============================


Multiple Hosts: 
----------------

If you want to create :ref:`service dependencies <configobjects/servicedependency>` for services of the same name/description that are assigned to multiple hosts, you can specify multiple hosts in the "host_name" and or "dependent_host_name" directives. In the example below, service SERVICE2 on hosts HOST3 and HOST4 would be dependent on service SERVICE1 on hosts HOST1 and HOST2. All the instances of the service dependencies would be identical except for the host names (i.e. have the same notification failure criteria, etc.).

  
::

  define servicedependency{
      host_name                       HOST1,HOST2
      service_description             SERVICE1
      dependent_host_name             HOST3,HOST4
      dependent_service_description   SERVICE2
      other dependency directives ...
  }


All Hosts In Multiple Hostgroups: 
----------------------------------

If you want to create service dependencies for services of the same name/description that are assigned to all hosts in in one or more hostgroups, you can do use the "hostgroup_name" and/or "dependent_hostgroup_name" directives. In the example below, service SERVICE2 on all hosts in hostgroups HOSTGROUP3 and HOSTGROUP4 would be dependent on service SERVICE1 on all hosts in hostgroups HOSTGROUP1 and HOSTGROUP2. Assuming there were five hosts in each of the hostgroups, this definition would be equivalent to creating 100 single service dependency definitions ! All the instances of the service dependency would be identical except for the host names (i.e. have the same notification failure criteria, etc.).

  
::

  define servicedependency{
      hostgroup_name                  HOSTGROUP1,HOSTGROUP2
      service_description             SERVICE1
      dependent_hostgroup_name        HOSTGROUP3,HOSTGROUP4
      dependent_service_description   SERVICE2
      other dependency directives ...
  }


All Services On A Host: 
------------------------

If you want to create service dependencies for all services assigned to a particular host, you can use a wildcard in the "service_description" and/or "dependent_service_description" directives. In the example below, all services on host HOST2 would be dependent on all services on host HOST1. All the instances of the service dependencies would be identical (i.e. have the same notification failure criteria, etc.).

  
::

  define servicedependency{
      host_name                       HOST1
      service_description             *
      dependent_host_name             HOST2
      dependent_service_description   *
      other dependency directives ...
  }


Multiple Services On A Host: 
-----------------------------

If you want to create service dependencies for multiple services assigned to a particular host, you can specify more than one service description in the "service_description" and/or "dependent_service_description" directives as follows:

  
::

  define servicedependency{
      host_name                       HOST1
      service_description             SERVICE1,SERVICE2,...,SERVICEN
      dependent_host_name             HOST2
      dependent_service_description   SERVICE1,SERVICE2,...,SERVICEN
      other dependency directives ...
  }


All Services In Multiple Servicegroups: 
----------------------------------------

If you want to create service dependencies for all services that belong in one or more servicegroups, you can do use the "servicegroup_name" and/or "dependent_servicegroup_name" directive as follows:

  
::

  define servicedependency{
      servicegroup_name               SERVICEGROUP1,SERVICEGROUP2,...,SERVICEGROUPN
      dependent_servicegroup_name     SERVICEGROUP3,SERVICEGROUP4,...SERVICEGROUPN
      other dependency directives ...
  }

.. _advanced/objecttricks#same_host_dependencies:

Same Host Dependencies: 
------------------------

If you want to create service dependencies for multiple services that are dependent on services on the same host, leave the "dependent_host_name" and "dependent_hostgroup_name" directives empty. The example below assumes that hosts HOST1 and HOST2 have at least the following four services associated with them: SERVICE1, SERVICE2, SERVICE3, and SERVICE4. In this example, SERVICE3 and SERVICE4 on HOST1 will be dependent on both SERVICE1 and SERVICE2 on HOST1. Similiarly, SERVICE3 and SERVICE4 on HOST2 will be dependent on both SERVICE1 and SERVICE2 on HOST2.

  
::

  define servicedependency{
      host_name                       HOST1,HOST2
      service_description             SERVICE1,SERVICE2
      dependent_service_description   SERVICE3,SERVICE4
      other dependency directives ...
  }

      host_name             HOST1,HOST2,!HOST3,!HOST4,...,HOSTN
      hostgroup_name        HOSTGROUP1,HOSTGROUP2,!HOSTGROUP3,!HOSTGROUP4,...,HOSTGROUPN
      other escalation directives ...
  }

----------------

If you want to create :ref:`host dependencies <configobjects/hostdependency>` for multiple hosts, you can specify multiple hosts in the "host_name" and/or "dependent_host_name" directives. The definition below would be equivalent to creating six seperate host dependencies. In the example above, hosts HOST3, HOST4 and HOST5 would be dependent upon both HOST1 and HOST2. All the instances of the host dependencies would be identical except for the host names (i.e. have the same notification failure criteria, etc.).

  
::

  define hostdependency{
      host_name               HOST1,HOST2
      dependent_host_name     HOST3,HOST4,HOST5
      other dependency directives ...

      other dependency directives ...
  }
  


.. _advanced/objecttricks#hostgroup:

Hostgroups 
===========


All Hosts: 
-----------

If you want to create a hostgroup that has all hosts that are defined in your configuration files as members, you can use a wildcard in the "members" directive. The definition below would create a hostgroup called HOSTGROUP1 that has all all hosts that are defined in your configuration files as members.

  
::

  define hostgroup{
      hostgroup_name          HOSTGROUP1
      members                 *
      other hostgroup directives ...
  }
