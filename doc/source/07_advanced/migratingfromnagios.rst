Migrating from Nagios to Shinken 
=================================


How to to import existing Nagios states 
========================================

It's possible with the *nagios_retention_file* module in fact.

**The "migration" is done in two phases :**

- First you launch shinken with both NagiosRetention and PickleRetention modules. It will load data from NagiosRetention and save them in a more "efficient" file. So add in *shinken-specififc.cfg* file both modules for your scheduler object: 

::

  modules                 NagiosRetention ,PickleRetention

- Then you remove the NagiosRetention (it's a read only module, don't fear for your nagios retention file) and restart with just PickleRetention. <code>modules                 PickleRetention

You're done.

.. important::  This method has met with limited success, further testing of the NagiosRetention module is required. An issues encountered should be raised in the Shinken issue tracker on github.
