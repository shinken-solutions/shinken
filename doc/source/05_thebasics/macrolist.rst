 Standard Macros in Shinken 
============================


Standard macros that are available in Shinken are listed here. On-demand macros and macros for custom variables are described :ref:`here <thebasics/macros>`.


Macro Validity 
===============

Although macros can be used in all commands you define, not all macros may be valid" in a particular type of command. For example, some macros may only be valid during service notification commands, whereas other may only be valid during host check commands. There are ten types of commands that Nagios recognizes and treats differently. They are as follows:

  * Service checks
  * Service notifications
  * Host checks
  * Host notifications
  * Service :ref:`event handlers <advanced/eventhandlers>` and/or a global service event handler
  * Host :ref:`event handlers <advanced/eventhandlers>` and/or a global host event handler
  * :ref:`OCSP <configuration/configmain-advanced#ocsp_command>` command
  * :ref:`OCHP <configuration/configmain-advanced#ochp_command>` command
  * Service :ref:`performance data <advanced/perfdata>` commands
  * Host :ref:`performance data <advanced/perfdata>` commands

The tables below list all macros currently available in Shinken, along with a brief description of each and the types of commands in which they are valid. If a macro is used in a command in which it is invalid, it is replaced with an empty string. It should be noted that macros consist of all uppercase characters and are enclosed in $ characters.

_`$LASTHOSTSTATEID$`                                             A number that corresponds to the last state of the host: 0=UP, 1=DOWN, 2=UNREACHABLE.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
_`$HOSTSTATETYPE$`                                               A string indicating the :ref:`state type <thebasics/statetypes>` for the current host check ("HARD" or "SOFT"). Soft states occur when host checks return a non-OK (non-UP) state and are in the process of being retried. Hard states result when host checks have been checked a specified maximum number of times.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
_`$HOSTATTEMPT$`                                                 The number of the current host check retry. For instance, if this is the second time that the host is being rechecked, this will be the number two. Current attempt number is really only useful when writing host event handlers for "soft" states that take a specific action based on the host retry number.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
_`$MAXHOSTATTEMPTS$`                                             The max check attempts as defined for the current host. Useful when writing host event handlers for "soft" states that take a specific action based on the host retry number.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
_`$HOSTEVENTID$`                                                 A globally unique number associated with the host's current state. Every time a host (or service) experiences a state change, a global event ID number is incremented by one (1). If a host has experienced no state changes, this macro will be set to zero (0).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
_`$LASTHOSTEVENTID$`                                             The previous (globally unique) event number that was given to the host.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
_`$HOSTPROBLEMID$`                                               A globally unique number associated with the host's current problem state. Every time a host (or service) transitions from an UP or OK state to a problem state, a global problem ID number is incremented by one (1). This macro will be non-zero if the host is currently a non-UP state. State transitions between non-UP states (e.g. DOWN to UNREACHABLE) do not cause this problem id to increase. If the host is currently in an UP state, this macro will be set to zero (0). Combined with event handlers, this macro could be used to automatically open trouble tickets when hosts first enter a problem state.            
_`$LASTHOSTPROBLEMID$`                                           The previous (globally unique) problem number that was given to the host. Combined with event handlers, this macro could be used for automatically closing trouble tickets, etc. when a host recovers to an UP state.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
_`$HOSTLATENCY$`                                                 A (floating point) number indicating the number of seconds that a scheduled host check lagged behind its scheduled check time. For instance, if a check was scheduled for 03:14:15 and it didn't get executed until 03:14:17, there would be a check latency of 2.0 seconds. On-demand host checks have a latency of zero seconds.

_`$SERVICESTATETYPE$`                                            A string indicating the :ref:`state type <thebasics/statetypes>` for the current service check ("HARD" or "SOFT"). Soft states occur when service checks return a non-OK state and are in the process of being retried. Hard states result when service checks have been checked a specified maximum number of times.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
_`$SERVICEATTEMPT$`                                              The number of the current service check retry. For instance, if this is the second time that the service is being rechecked, this will be the number two. Current attempt number is really only useful when writing service event handlers for "soft" states that take a specific action based on the service retry number.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
_`$MAXSERVICEATTEMPTS$`                                          The max check attempts as defined for the current service. Useful when writing host event handlers for "soft" states that take a specific action based on the service retry number.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
_`$SERVICEISVOLATILE$`                                           Indicates whether the service is marked as being volatile or not: 0 = not volatile, 1 = volatile.

_`$SERVICEPROBLEMID$`                                            A globally unique number associated with the service's current problem state. Every time a service (or host) transitions from an OK or UP state to a problem state, a global problem ID number is incremented by one (1). This macro will be non-zero if the service is currently a non-OK state. State transitions between non-OK states (e.g. WARNING to CRITICAL) do not cause this problem id to increase. If the service is currently in an OK state, this macro will be set to zero (0). Combined with event handlers, this macro could be used to automatically open trouble tickets when services first enter a problem state.
_`$LASTSERVICEPROBLEMID$`                                        The previous (globally unique) problem number that was given to the service. Combined with event handlers, this macro could be used for automatically closing trouble tickets, etc. when a service recovers to an OK state.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
_`$SERVICELATENCY$`                                              A (floating point) number indicating the number of seconds that a scheduled service check lagged behind its scheduled check time. For instance, if a check was scheduled for 03:14:15 and it didn't get executed until 03:14:17, there would be a check latency of 2.0 seconds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
_`$SERVICEEXECUTIONTIME$`                                        A (floating point) number indicating the number of seconds that the service check took to execute (i.e. the amount of time the check was executing).

If the $NOTIFICATIONTYPE$ macro is "ACKNOWLEDGEMENT", this will be the name of the user who acknowledged the host or service problem. If the $NOTIFICATIONTYPE$ macro is "CUSTOM", this will be name of the user who initated the custom host or service notification.

_`$NOTIFICATIONAUTHORALIAS$`                                     A string containing the alias of the contact (if applicable) specified in the $NOTIFICATIONAUTHOR$ macro.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
_`$NOTIFICATIONCOMMENT$`                                         A string containing the comment that was entered by the notification author. If the $NOTIFICATIONTYPE$ macro is set to "DOWNTIMESTART" or "DOWNTIMEEND", this will be the comment entered by the user who scheduled downtime for the host or service. If the $NOTIFICATIONTYPE$ macro is "ACKNOWLEDGEMENT", this will be the comment entered by the user who acknowledged the host or service problem. If the $NOTIFICATIONTYPE$ macro is "CUSTOM", this will be comment entered by the user who initated the custom host or service notification.                                                                                    
_`$HOSTNOTIFICATIONNUMBER$`                                      The current notification number for the host. The notification number increases by one (1) each time a new notification is sent out for the host (except for acknowledgements). The notification number is reset to 0 when the host recovers (after the recovery notification has gone out). Acknowledgements do not cause the notification number to increase, nor do notifications dealing with flap detection or scheduled downtime.                                                                                                                                                                                               
_`$HOSTNOTIFICATIONID$`                                          A unique number identifying a host notification. Notification ID numbers are unique across both hosts and service notifications, so you could potentially use this unique number as a primary key in a notification database. Notification ID numbers should remain unique across restarts of the Nagios process, so long as you have state retention enabled. The notification ID number is incremented by one (1) each time a new host notification is sent out, and regardless of how many contacts are notified.                                                                                                                  
_`$SERVICENOTIFICATIONNUMBER$`                                   The current notification number for the service. The notification number increases by one (1) each time a new notification is sent out for the service (except for acknowledgements). The notification number is reset to 0 when the service recovers (after the recovery notification has gone out). Acknowledgements do not cause the notification number to increase, nor do notifications dealing with flap detection or scheduled downtime.                                                                                                                                                                                      
_`$SERVICENOTIFICATIONID$`                                       A unique number identifying a service notification. Notification ID numbers are unique across both hosts and service notifications, so you could potentially use this unique number as a primary key in a notification database. Notification ID numbers should remain unique across restarts of the Nagios process, so long as you have state retention enabled. The notification ID number is incremented by one (1) each time a new service notification is sent out, and regardless of how many contacts are notified.

_`$PROCESSSTARTTIME$`                                            Time stamp in time_t format (seconds since the UNIX epoch) indicating when the Nagios process was last (re)started. You can determine the number of seconds that Nagios has been running (since it was last restarted) by subtracting $PROCESSSTARTTIME$ from :ref:`$TIMET$ <$TIMET$>`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
_`$EVENTSTARTTIME$`                                              Time stamp in time_t format (seconds since the UNIX epoch) indicating when the Nagios process starting process events (checks, etc.). You can determine the number of seconds that it took for Nagios to startup by subtracting $PROCESSSTARTTIME$ from $EVENTSTARTTIME$.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
_`$ADMINEMAIL$` (unused)                                         Global administrative email address. This value is taken from the :ref:`admin_email <configuration/configmain-advanced#admin_email>` directive.
_`$ADMINPAGER$` (unused)                                         Global administrative pager number/address. This value is taken from the :ref:`admin_pager <configuration/configmain-advanced#admin_pager>` directive.
_`$ARGn$`                                                        The nth argument passed to the command (notification, event handler, service check, etc.). Nagios supports up to 32 argument macros ($ARG1$ through $ARG32$).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
_`$USERn$`                                                       The nth user-definable macro. User macros can be defined in one or more :ref:`resource files <configuration/configmain#resource_file>`. Nagios supports up to 32 user macros ($USER1$ through $USER32$).

Notes 
======

.. _thebasics/macrolist#note1:

  * **01** These macros are not valid for the host they are associated with when that host is being checked (i.e. they make no sense, as they haven't been determined yet).

.. _thebasics/macrolist#note2:

  * **02** These macros are not valid for the service they are associated with when that service is being checked (i.e. they make no sense, as they haven't been determined yet).

.. _thebasics/macrolist#note3:

  * **03** When host macros are used in service-related commands (i.e. service notifications, event handlers, etc) they refer to the host that the service is associated with.

.. _thebasics/macrolist#note4:

  * **04** When host and service summary macros are used in notification commands, the totals are filtered to reflect only those hosts and services for which the contact is authorized (i.e. hosts and services they are configured to receive notifications for).

.. _thebasics/macrolist#note5:

  * **05** These macros are normally associated with the first/primary hostgroup associated with the current host. They could therefore be considered host macros in many cases. However, these macros are not available as on-demand host macros. Instead, they can be used as on-demand hostgroup macros when you pass the name of a hostgroup to the macro. For example: $HOSTGROUPMEMBERS:hg1$ would return a comma-delimited list of all (host) members of the hostgroup hg1.

.. _thebasics/macrolist#note6:

  * **06** These macros are normally associated with the first/primary servicegroup associated with the current service. They could therefore be considered service macros in many cases. However, these macros are not available as on-demand service macros. Instead, they can be used as on-demand servicegroup macros when you pass the name of a servicegroup to the macro. For example: $SERVICEGROUPMEMBERS:sg1$ would return a comma-delimited list of all (service) members of the servicegroup sg1.

.. _thebasics/macrolist#note7:

  * **07** These macros are normally associated with the first/primary contactgroup associated with the current contact. They could therefore be considered contact macros in many cases. However, these macros are not available as on-demand contact macros. Instead, they can be used as on-demand contactgroup macros when you pass the name of a contactgroup to the macro. For example: $CONTACTGROUPMEMBERS:cg1$ would return a comma-delimited list of all (contact) members of the contactgroup cg1.

.. _thebasics/macrolist#note8:

  * **08** These acknowledgement macros are deprecated. Use the more generic $NOTIFICATIONAUTHOR$, $NOTIFICATIONAUTHORNAME$, $NOTIFICATIONAUTHORALIAS$ or $NOTIFICATIONAUTHORCOMMENT$ macros instead.

.. _thebasics/macrolist#note9:

  * **09** These macro are only available as on-demand macros - e.g. you must supply an additional argument with them in order to use them. These macros are not available as environment variables.

.. _thebasics/macrolist#note10:

  * **10** Summary macros are not available as environment variables if the :ref:`use_large_installation_tweaks <configuration/configmain-advanced#use_large_installation_tweaks>` option is enabled, as they are quite CPU-intensive to calculate.
