Graphite 
---------

  * Homepage: `Graphite`_
  * Screenshots: 
  * presentation: http://pivotallabs.com/talks/139-metrics-metrics-everywhere
  * Description: "Graphite is an easy to use scalable time-series database and a web API that can provide raw data for client rendering or server side rendering. It is the evolution of RRDtool."
  * License: GPL v2

Install graphite 
-----------------


The best installation guide is actually `this youtube walkthrough from Jason Dixon`_ (Obfuscurity). There is a `Chef recipe for the above demonstration`_.

See http://graphite.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html documentation tells what to install but not how to configure Apache and Django.

See `Installing Graphite version 0.9.8`_ example. Just update for version 0.9.10 it is the exact same installation steps. The vhost example also worked for me, while the wsgi examples did not for me. 

Make sure you set the timezone properly in ''/opt/graphite/webapp/graphite/local_settings.py'', for instance:
  
::

  TIME_ZONE = 'Europe/Paris'</code>
  
  


Using Shinken with Graphite 
----------------------------

  
  The Shinken Broker module **graphite** is in charge of exporting performance data from Shinken to the Graphite databases.
  


Configure graphite module 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  
::

  define module{
      module_name     Graphite-Perfdata
      module_type     graphite_perfdata
      host            localhost
      port            2003
      templates_path  /usr/local/shinken/share/templates/graphite/
  }

Additional list of options for the :ref:`Graphite export module and more in-depth documentation <the_broker_modules#network_based_modules_-_graphite_graphing>`.



Enable it 
~~~~~~~~~~


Edit ''/etc/shinken/shinken-specific.cfg'' and find the **Broker** object, and add the graphite module to its **modules** line:

  
::

  define broker{
       broker_name      broker-1
      [...]
       modules          Livestatus,Simple-log,WebUI,Graphite-Perfdata
  }


Use it 
~~~~~~~


With Shinken UI 
****************


Still in ''/etc/shinken/shinken-specific.cfg'', find the GRAPHITE_UI object and configure the URL to your Graphite install.
If you used a graphite_data_source in the Graphite-Perfdata section, make sure to specify it here as well.
  
::

  define module {
      module_name GRAPHITE_UI
      uri http://monitoring.mysite.com/graphite/
      graphite_data_source shinken
      ...
  }

Then find the WebUI object, and add GRAPHITE_UI to its modules (you'll want to replace PNP_UI):
  
::

  define module {
      module_name WebUI
      modules Apache_passwd, ActiveDir_UI, Cfg_password, GRAPHITE_UI, Mongodb
      ...
  }

Restart Shinken to take the changes into account.

You have to possibility to use graphite template files. They are located in "templates_path", (from the graphite_webui module)
They are file containing graphite urls with shinken contextual variables.
Ex : 

''${uri}render/?width=586&height=308&target=alias(legendValue(${host}.${service}.'user'%2C%22last%22)%2C%22User%22)&target=alias(legendValue(${host}.${service}.'sys'%2C%22last%22)%2C%22Sys%22)&target=alias(legendValue(${host}.${service}.'softirq'%2C%22last%22)%2C%22SoftIRQ%22)&target=alias(legendValue(${host}.${service}.'nice'%2C%22last%22)%2C%22Nice%22)&target=alias(legendValue(${host}.${service}.'irq'%2C%22last%22)%2C%22IRQ%22)&target=alias(legendValue(${host}.${service}.'iowait'%2C%22last%22)%2C%22I%2FO%20Wait%22)&target=alias(legendValue(${host}.${service}.'idle'%2C%22last%22)%2C%22Idle%22)&fgcolor=000000&bgcolor=FFFFFF)&areaMode=stacked&yMax=100''

is used for check_cpu. Split this string using & as a separator to understand it. It's quite easy. Use graphite uri api doc.

Shinken uses the templates tht matches the check_command, like pnp does.

.. important::  The suggested configuration below is not final and has just been created, the documentation needs to be updated for the correct usage of the .graph templates used in WebUI. There are a number of the already created, see the existing packs to learn how to use them properly. Sorry for the inconvenience.



with Thruk 
***********

:ref:`Thruk <use_with_thruk>` offers a proper integration with PNP, but not with Graphite.
Still, you can use graphite with Thruk. Simply use the **action_url** for your service/host to link toward the graphite url you want. Use HOSTNAME and SERVICEDESC macros. 
The action_url icon will be a link to the graph in Thruk UI.
For ex : 

'' http://MYGRAPHITE/render/?lineMode=connected&width=586&height=308&_salt=1355923874.899&target=cactiStyle($HOSTNAME$.$SERVICEDESC$.*)&xFormat=%25H%3A%25M&tz=Europe/Paris&bgcolor=DDDDDD&fgcolor=111111&majorGridLineColor=black&minorGridLineColor=grey''

is what I use in my :ref:`Thruk <use_with_thruk>`.

A change has been pushed in thruk's github to grant Thruk the features it has for pnp to graphite. The rule above (use action_url) still applies. Graphite will be displayed when the action_url contains the keyword "render".

.. important::   The graphite template files feature is not used in Thruk. It is a "shinken UI only" feature.




Enjoy it 
~~~~~~~~~


Restart shinken-arbiter and you are done.

::

  /etc/init.d/shinken-arbiter restart</code>
