Using Shinken with Multisite 
=============================

Multisite communicates with Shinken through the LiveStatus module. If you used the sample configuration, everything should be ready already. :)

You can review the configuration using the following steps.


Enable Livestatus module 
-------------------------

See :ref:`enable Livestatus module <enable_livestatus_module>`.


Configure Multisite 
--------------------

Latest versions of Multisite are included into Check_MK, which must be fully installed although we will only use the web interface.

To install and configure Multisite manually, follow `instructions at MK website`_.

Best choice is to use Shinken **:ref:`install script <gettingstarted/installations/shinken-installation#method_1the_easy_way>`** (In Shinken versions >1.0). With addons installation option (''./install -a multisite'') it is fast and easy to install and configure it as Multisite's default site.

.. warning::  If you get some error installing Multisite related with unknown paths ("can not find Multisite_versionXXX") perhaps you must edit ''init.d/shinken.conf'' file and adjust MKVER variable (search for "export MKVER") with current stable available version of Check_MK as stated on MK website.


Check_MK install quick guide 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


  - Install check_mk: Detailed `instructions`_ there. Shell driven install with a lot of questions related with Check_mk install paths and integration with Apache and existing "Nagios". For Shinken some default answers must be changed to accomodate Shinken install.
  - Edit config file ''multisite.mk'', usually in ''/etc/check_mk'', to insert a new site pointing to Shinken and write Livestatus socket address as declared at :ref:`Shinken's Livestatus module <enable_livestatus_module>`. Socket may also be an unix socket ("unix:/some/other/path").
  - Restart Apache.

''/etc/check_mk/multisite.mk'':

::

    sites = {
      "munich": {
          "alias": "Munich"
      },
      "Shinken": {
         "alias":          "Shinken",
         "socket":         "tcp:127.0.0.1:50000",
         "url_prefix":     "http://shinken.fqdn/",
       },
    }


.. note::  Replace "shinken.fqdn" with the complete URI to reach Shinken host from browser (not 127.0.0.1!). Used by PNP4Nagios's mouse-over images.

If you plan to use Multisite only as web UI no more configuration is needed. Also you can disable WATO (Web Administration TOol) by including the line **wato_enabled = False** in ''multisite.mk''.
