This document explains how to easily generate alerts in Shinken for connection attempts that are rejected by TCP wrappers. For example, if an unauthorized host attempts to connect to your "SSH" server, you can receive an alert in Shinken that contains the name of the host that was rejected. If you implement this on your Linux/Unix boxes, you'll be surprised how many port scans you can detect across your network.

These directions assume:

  - You are already familiar with :ref:`Passive Checks <thebasics/passivechecks>` and how they work.
  - You are already familiar with :ref:`Volatile Services <advanced/volatileservices>` and how they work.
  - The host which you are generating alerts for (i.e. the host you are using TCP wrappers on) is a remote host (called firestorm in this example). If you want to generate alerts on the same host that Shinken is running you will need to make a few modifications to the examples I provide.
  - You have installed the :ref:`NSCA daemon <nsca_daemon_module>` on your monitoring server and the NSCA client (**send_nsca**) on the remote machine that you are generating TCP wrapper alerts from.


Defining A Service 
===================

If you haven't done so already, create a :ref:`host definition <configobjects/host>` for the remote host (firestorm).

Next, define a service in one of your :ref:`object configuration files <configuration/configobject>` for the TCP wrapper alerts on host firestorm. The service definition might look something like this:

  
::

  define service{
      " " " " host_name " " " " " " " " " " " firestorm
      " " " " service_description " " " " " " TCP Wrappers
      " " " " is_volatile " " " " " " " " " " 1
      " " " " active_checks_enabled " " " " " 0
      " " " " passive_checks_enabled " " " " "1
      " " " " max_check_attempts " " " " " " "1
      " " " " check_command " " " " " " " " " check_none
      " " " " ...
      " " " " }
  
There are some important things to note about the above service definition:

  - The volatile option enabled. We want this option enabled because we want a notification to be generated for every alert that comes in.
  - Active checks of the service as disabled, while passive checks are enabled. This means that the service will never be actively checked by Shinken - all alert information will have to be received passively from an external source.
  - The "max_check_attempts" value is set to "1". This guarantees you will get a notification when the first alert is generated.


Configuring TCP Wrappers 
=========================

Now you're going to have to modify the /etc/hosts.deny file on firestorm. In order to have the TCP wrappers send an alert to the monitoring host whenever a connection attempt is denied, you'll have to add a line similiar to the following:

  
::

  ALL: ALL: RFC931: twist (/usr/local/shinken/libexec/eventhandlers/handle_tcp_wrapper %h %d)&
  
This line assumes that there is a script called handle_tcp_wrapper in the "/usr/local/shinken/libexec/eventhandlers/" directory on firestorm. We'll write that script next.


Writing The Script 
===================

The last thing you need to do is write the handle_tcp_wrapper script on firestorm that will send the alert back to the Shinken server. It might look something like this:

  
::

      	#!/bin/sh
  	/usr/local/shinken/libexec/eventhandlers/submit_check_result firestorm "TCP Wrappers" 2 "Denied $2-$1" > /dev/null 2> /dev/null
  
Notice that the **handle_tcp_wrapper** script calls the **submit_check_result** script to actually send the alert back to the monitoring host. Assuming your Shinken server is called monitor, the **submit_check_result** script might look like this:

  
::

  #!/bin/sh
  # Arguments
  #	$1 = name of host in service definition
  #	$2 = name/description of service in service definition
  #	$3 = return code
  #	$4 = outputs
  
  /bin/echo -e "$1\t$2\t$3\t$4\n" | /usr/local/shinken/bin/send_nsca monitor -c /usr/local/shinken/etc/send_nsca.cfg


Finishing Up 
=============

You've now configured everything you need to, so all you have to do is restart the inetd process on firestorm and restart Shinken on your monitoring server. That's it! When the TCP wrappers on firestorm deny a connection attempt, you should be getting alerts in Shinken. The plugin output for the alert will look something like the following: "Denied sshd2-sdn-ar-002mnminnP321.dialsprint.net"
