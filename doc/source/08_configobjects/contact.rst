Directive Descriptions 
=======================

contact_name
  This directive is used to define a short name used to identify the contact. It is referenced in :ref:`contact group <configobjects/contactgroup>` definitions. Under the right circumstances, the $CONTACTNAME$ :ref:`macro <thebasics/macros>` will contain this value.

alias
  This directive is used to define a longer name or description for the contact. Under the rights circumstances, the $CONTACTALIAS$ :ref:`macro <thebasics/macros>` will contain this value. If not specified, the *contact_name* will be used as the alias.

contactgroups
  This directive is used to identify the *short name(s)* of the :ref:`contactgroup(s) <configobjects/contactgroup>` that the contact belongs to. Multiple contactgroups should be separated by commas. This directive may be used as an alternative to (or in addition to) using the *members* directive in :ref:`contactgroup <configobjects/contactgroup>` definitions.

host_notifications_enabled
  This directive is used to determine whether or not the contact will receive notifications about host problems and recoveries. Values :
  
    * 0 = don't send notifications
    * 1 = send notifications

    * 0 = don't send notifications
    * 1 = send notifications

host_notification_period
  This directive is used to specify the short name of the :ref:`time period <configobjects/timeperiod>` during which the contact can be notified about host problems or recoveries. You can think of this as an “on call" time for host notifications for the contact. Read the documentation on :ref:`time periods <thebasics/timeperiods>` for more information on how this works and potential problems that may result from improper use.

service_notification_period
  This directive is used to specify the short name of the :ref:`time period <configobjects/timeperiod>` during which the contact can be notified about service problems or recoveries. You can think of this as an “on call" time for service notifications for the contact. Read the documentation on :ref:`time periods <thebasics/timeperiods>` for more information on how this works and potential problems that may result from improper use.

host_notification_commands
  This directive is used to define a list of the *short names* of the :ref:`commands <configobjects/command>` used to notify the contact of a *host* problem or recovery. Multiple notification commands should be separated by commas. All notification commands are executed when the contact needs to be notified. The maximum amount of time that a notification command can run is controlled by the :ref:`notification_timeout <configuration/configmain-advanced#notification_timeout>` option.

host_notification_options
  This directive is used to define the host states for which notifications can be sent out to this contact. Valid options are a combination of one or more of the following:
  
    * d = notify on DOWN host states
    * u = notify on UNREACHABLE host states
    * r = notify on host recoveries (UP states)
    * f = notify when the host starts and stops :ref:`flapping <advanced/flapping>`,
    * s = send notifications when host or service :ref:`scheduled downtime <advanced/downtime>` starts and ends. If you specify **n** (none) as an option, the contact will not receive any type of host notifications.

    * w = notify on WARNING service states
    * u = notify on UNKNOWN service states
    * c = notify on CRITICAL service states
    * r = notify on service recoveries (OK states)
