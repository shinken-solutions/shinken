Poller Definition 
==================


Description 
============

The Poller object is a way to the Arbiter daemons to talk with a scheduler and give it hosts to manage. They are in charge of launching plugins as requested by schedulers. When the check is finished they return the result to the schedulers. There can be many pollers.

The Poller definition is optionnal. If no poller is defined, Shinken will "create" one for the user. There will be no high availability for it (no spare), and will use the default port in the server where the deamon is launched.


Definition Format 
==================

Variables in red are required, while those in black are optional. However, you need to supply at least one optional variable in each definition for it to be of much use.

================= ========================
define poller{                            
poller_name       *poller_name*

Variable Descriptions 
======================

poller_name
  This variable is used to identify the *short name* of the poller which the data is associated with.

address
  This directive is used to define the adress from where the main arbier can reach this poller. This can be a DNS name or a IP adress.

port
  This directive is used to define the TCP port used bu the daemon. The default value is *7771*.

spare
  This variable is used to define if the poller must be managed as a spare one (will take the conf only if a master failed). The default value is *0* (master).

realm
  This variable is used to define the :ref:`realm <configobjects/realm>` where the poller will be put. If none is selected, it will be assigned to the default one.

manage_sub_realms
  This variable is used to define if the poller will take jobs from scheduler from the sub-realms of it's realm. The default value is *0*.

poller_tags
  This variable is used to define the checks the poller can take. If no poller_tags is defined, poller will take all untagued checks. If at least one tag is defined, it will take only the checks that are also taggued like it.
  By default, there is no poller_tag, so poller can take all untagued checks (default).

modules
  This variable is used to define all modules that the scheduler will load.
