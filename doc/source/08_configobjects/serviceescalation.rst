Service Escalation Definition 
==============================


Description 
============

Service escalations are completely optional and are used to escalate notifications for a particular service. More information on how notification escalations work can be found :ref:`here <advanced/escalations>`.


Definition Format 
==================

Bold directives are required, while the others are optional.

Example Definition 
===================

Here for an scalation that will escalade to "themanagers" after one hour problem and ends at 2 hours.

::

  define serviceescalation{
      host_name                  nt-3
      service_description        Processor Load
      first_notification_time    60
      last_notification_time     120
      notification_interval      30
      contact_groups             themanagers
  }


Directive Descriptions 
=======================

host_name
  This directive is used to identify the *short name(s)* of the :ref:`host(s) <configobjects/host>` that the :ref:`service <configobjects/service>` escalation should apply to or is associated with.

hostgroup_name
  This directive is used to specify the *short name(s)* of the :ref:`hostgroup(s) <configobjects/hostgroup>` that the service escalation should apply to or is associated with. Multiple hostgroups should be separated by commas. The "hostgroup_name" may be used instead of, or in addition to, the "host_name" directive.

service_description
  This directive is used to identify the *description* of the :ref:`service <configobjects/service>` the escalation should apply to.

first_notification
  This directive is a number that identifies the *first* notification for which this escalation is effective. For instance, if you set this value to 3, this escalation will only be used if the service is in a non-OK state long enough for a third notification to go out.

last_notification
  This directive is a number that identifies the *last* notification for which this escalation is effective. For instance, if you set this value to 5, this escalation will not be used if more than five notifications are sent out for the service. Setting this value to 0 means to keep using this escalation entry forever (no matter how many notifications go out).

first_notification_time
  This directive is the number of "time intervals" (60 seconds by default) until that makes the *first* notification for which this escalation is effective. For instance, if you set this value to 60, this escalation will only be used if the service is in a non-OK state long enough for 60 minutes notification to go out.

last_notification_time
  This directive is a number of "time intervals" (60 seconds by default) until that makes the *last* notification for which this escalation is effective. For instance, if you set this value to 120, this escalation will not be used if more than two hours after then notifications are sent out for the service. Setting this value to 0 means to keep using this escalation entry forever (no matter how many notifications go out).

contacts
  This is a list of the *short names* of the :ref:`contacts <configobjects/contact>` that should be notified whenever there are problems (or recoveries) with this service. Multiple contacts should be separated by commas. Useful if you want notifications to go to just a few people and don't want to configure :ref:`contact groups <configobjects/contactgroup>`. You must specify at least one contact or contact group in each service escalation definition.

contact_groups
  This directive is used to identify the *short name* of the :ref:`contact group <configobjects/contactgroup>` that should be notified when the service notification is escalated. Multiple contact groups should be separated by commas. You must specify at least one contact or contact group in each service escalation definition.

notification_interval
  This directive is used to determine the interval at which notifications should be made while this escalation is valid. If you specify a value of 0 for the interval, Shinken will send the first notification when this escalation definition is valid, but will then prevent any more problem notifications from being sent out for the host. Notifications are sent out again until the host recovers. This is useful if you want to stop having notifications sent out after a certain amount of time.
  
  If multiple escalation entries for a host overlap for one or more notification ranges, the smallest notification interval from all escalation entries is used.

escalation_period
  This directive is used to specify the short name of the :ref:`time period <configobjects/timeperiod>` during which this escalation is valid. If this directive is not specified, the escalation is considered to be valid during all times.

escalation_options
  This directive is used to define the criteria that determine when this service escalation is used. The escalation is used only if the service is in one of the states specified in this directive. If this directive is not specified in a service escalation, the escalation is considered to be valid during all service states. Valid options are a combination of one or more of the following:
  
    * **r** = escalate on an OK (recovery) state
    * **w** = escalate on a WARNING state
    * **u** = escalate on an UNKNOWN state
    * **c** = escalate on a CRITICAL state

If you specify **w** in this field, the escalation will only be used if the service is in a WARNING state.
