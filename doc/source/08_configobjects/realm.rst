Realm Definition 
=================


Description 
============

The realms are a optional feature useful if the administrator want to divide it's resources like schedulers or pollers.

The Realm definition is optional. If no scheduler is defined, Shinken will "create" one for the user and will be the default one.


Definition Format 
==================

Variables in red are required, while those in black are optional. However, you need to supply at least one optional variable in each definition for it to be of much use.

realm_name    *realm_name*
