Host Escalation Definition 
===========================


Description 
============

Host escalations are completely optional and are used to escalate notifications for a particular host. More information on how notification escalations work can be found :ref:`here <advanced/escalations>`.


Definition Format 
==================

Bold directives are required, while the others are optional.


========================= =======================
define hostescalation{                           
**host_name**             ***host_name***        
hostgroup_name            *hostgroup_name*       
**contacts**              ***contacts***

========================= =======================


Example Definition 
===================

Escalate to all-router-admins after one hour of problem, and stop at 2 hours.

::

  define hostescalation{
      host_name               router-34
      first_notification      60
      last_notification       120
      notification_interval   60
      contact_groups          all-router-admins
  }


Directive Descriptions 
=======================

host_name
  This directive is used to identify the *short name* of the :ref:`host <configobjects/host>` that the escalation should apply to.

hostgroup_name
  This directive is used to identify the *short name(s)* of the :ref:`hostgroup(s) <configobjects/hostgroup>` that the escalation should apply to. Multiple hostgroups should be separated by commas. If this is used, the escalation will apply to all hosts that are members of the specified hostgroup(s).

first_notification
  This directive is a number that identifies the *first* notification for which this escalation is effective. For instance, if you set this value to 3, this escalation will only be used if the host is down or unreachable long enough for a third notification to go out.

last_notification
  This directive is a number that identifies the *last* notification for which this escalation is effective. For instance, if you set this value to 5, this escalation will not be used if more than five notifications are sent out for the host. Setting this value to 0 means to keep using this escalation entry forever (no matter how many notifications go out).

first_notification_time
  This directive is the number of "time intervals" (60 seconds by default) until that makes the *first* notification for which this escalation is effective. For instance, if you set this value to 60, this escalation will only be used if the host is in a non-OK state long enough for 60 minutes notification to go out.

last_notification_time
  This directive is a number of "time intervals" (60 seconds by default) until that makes the *last* notification for which this escalation is effective. For instance, if you set this value to 120, this escalation will not be used if more than two hours after then notifications are sent out for the service. Setting this value to 0 means to keep using this host entry forever (no matter how many notifications go out).
contacts
  This is a list of the *short names* of the :ref:`contacts <configobjects/contact>` that should be notified whenever there are problems (or recoveries) with this host. Multiple contacts should be separated by commas. Useful if you want notifications to go to just a few people and don't want to configure :ref:`contact groups <configobjects/contactgroup>`. You must specify at least one contact or contact group in each host escalation definition.

contact_groups
  This directive is used to identify the *short name* of the :ref:`contact group <configobjects/contactgroup>` that should be notified when the host notification is escalated. Multiple contact groups should be separated by commas. You must specify at least one contact or contact group in each host escalation definition.

notification_interval
  This directive is used to determine the interval at which notifications should be made while this escalation is valid. If you specify a value of 0 for the interval, Shinken will send the first notification when this escalation definition is valid, but will then prevent any more problem notifications from being sent out for the host. Notifications are sent out again until the host recovers. This is useful if you want to stop having notifications sent out after a certain amount of time.
  
  If multiple escalation entries for a host overlap for one or more notification ranges, the smallest notification interval from all escalation entries is used.
  

escalation_period
  This directive is used to specify the short name of the :ref:`time period <configobjects/timeperiod>` during which this escalation is valid. If this directive is not specified, the escalation is considered to be valid during all times.

escalation_options
  This directive is used to define the criteria that determine when this host escalation is used. The escalation is used only if the host is in one of the states specified in this directive. If this directive is not specified in a host escalation, the escalation is considered to be valid during all host states. Valid options are a combination of one or more of the following :
  
    * **r** = escalate on an UP (recovery) state
    * **d** = escalate on a DOWN state
    * **u** = escalate on an UNREACHABLE state
  

If you specify **d** in this field, the escalation will only be used if the host is in a DOWN state.
