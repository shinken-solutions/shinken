Description 
============

The Reactionner daemon is in charge of notifications and launching event_handlers. There can be more than one Reactionner.


Definition Format 
==================

Variables in red are required, while those in black are optional. However, you need to supply at least one optional variable in each definition for it to be of much use.

=================== ========================
define reactionner{                         
reactionner_name    *reactionner_name*      
address             *dns name of ip address*
port                *port*

Variable Descriptions 
======================

reactionner_name
  This variable is used to identify the *short name* of the reactionner which the data is associated with.

address
  This directive is used to define the address from where the main arbiter can reach this reactionner. This can be a DNS name or a IP address.

port
  This directive is used to define the TCP port used bu the daemon. The default value is *7772*.

spare
  This variable is used to define if the reactionner must be managed as a spare one (will take the conf only if a master failed). The default value is *0* (master).

realm
  This variable is used to define the :ref:`realm <configobjects/realm>` where the reactionner will be put. If none is selected, it will be assigned to the default one.

manage_sub_realms
  This variable is used to define if the poller will take jobs from scheduler from the sub-realms of it's realm. The default value is *1*.

modules
  This variable is used to define all modules that the reactionner will load.

reactionner_tags
  This variable is used to define the checks the reactionner can take. If no reactionner_tags is defined, reactionner  will take all untagued notifications and event handlers. If at least one tag is defined, it will take only the checks that are also taggued like it.

By default, there is no reactionner_tag, so reactionner can take all untagued notification/event handlers (default).
