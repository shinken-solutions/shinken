This part of Shinken is still under active work in progress and alpha phase.

Of course you can test it :)

To launch the Shinken Webui (if you got a cool name for it, let us know) it's very easy :
python webui/main.py

Then you can connect to http://localhost:8080/host to see an host detail, and /impacts to see the impacts page.
