Note : When you need to test an application you will test applications features. 
A feature is an application functionality.Say the application is an online shop,
features are catalog, shoping cart or order management. When you want to test a 
feature, you need to play some scenarios  ... .etc ...
  )
In order to test feature

document = {
  "key" => timestamp.application.feature.os.browser.localization
  "start_time" => when does the feature test did start (unix timestamp representation)
  "state" => 0=succeed or 2=failed
  "duration" => the global feature test duration

  "application" => application name 
  "application_code" => a normalized string of the application name
  "feature" => feature name
  "feature_code" => a normalized string of the feature name
  "description" => the complete feature description
  "scenarios" => scenarios of the features tests
    [
      {
        "key" => timestamp.application.feature.scenario.os.browser.localization,
        ""
      }
    ]

  "os" => which operating system was used to test the application feature
  "browser" => the browser name used to test the application feature
  "localization" => geographic where application was tested (country name at the moment)
  "robot" => which robot did execute the feature test

  "video" => the video file name of the feature test
