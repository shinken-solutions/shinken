This is a first attempt to make nconf working with shinken
The patch is about shinken engine recognition by nconf 1.3.0-0

first install nconf the classical way and then:

cd /var/www/nconf/include/ajax
patch -p0 < /path/to/patch/exec_generate_config.php.patch

Do not forget to edit/replace the deployment.ini file located in config folder!
