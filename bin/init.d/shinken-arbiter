# Short-Description: Shinken arbiter daemon
# Description:       Shinken is a monitoring tool and the Arbiter
#                    is one of its daemon. This one reads the configuration,
#                    cuts it into parts and dispatches it. Then it waits
#                    for orders from the users to dispatch them too.
